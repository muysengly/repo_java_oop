## Naming Conventions

### Variables

- **camelCase**: The most common style for variables. The first word is lowercase, and subsequent words start with an uppercase letter.  
   _Example_: `myVariableName`, `userAge`

- **snake_case**: Words are separated by underscores, and all letters are lowercase. Common in Python and databases.  
   _Example_: `my_variable_name`, `user_age`

- **Hungarian notation**: A prefix indicates the variable's data type. Less common in modern programming.  
   _Example_: `intCount`, `strName`

### Methods

- **camelCase**: Methods typically use camelCase.  
   _Example_: `calculateArea()`, `getUserData()`

- **Verb-based names**: Method names should start with a verb describing the action they perform.  
   _Example_: `submitForm()`, `processPayment()`

### Classes

- **PascalCase**: Also known as UpperCamelCase, each word starts with an uppercase letter.  
   _Example_: `MyClassName`, `UserDataManager`

- **Descriptive names**: Class names should be nouns that represent the object or concept they model.

### Constants

- **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE**: All uppercase letters with underscores.  
   _Example_: `MAX_VALUE`, `PI`
