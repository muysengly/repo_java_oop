## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

1. **Class**: Template for creating objects with specific attributes and methods.
2. **Object**: An instance of a class.
3. **Encapsulation**: Keeping data and methods together, hiding details from outside.
4. **Polymorphism**: Same method name can work differently for different objects.
5. **Inheritance**: A class can use features from another class.
6. **Abstraction**: Showing only important details, hiding complexity.
