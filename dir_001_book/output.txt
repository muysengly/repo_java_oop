the bus is built into the computer’s motherboard, which is a circuit case that connects all of 
the parts of a computer together.
1.2.1 Central Processing Unit
The central processing unit (CPU) is the computer’s brain. It retrieves instructions from the 
memory and executes them. The CPU usually has two components: a control unit and an arithmetic/logic unit. The control unit controls and coordinates the actions of the other com-ponents. The arithmetic/logic unit performs numeric operations (addition, subtraction, multi-plication, and division) and logical operations (comparisons).
Today’s CPUs are built on small silicon semiconductor chips that contain millions of tiny 
electric switches, called transistors, for processing information.
Every computer has an internal clock that emits electronic pulses at a constant rate. These 
pulses are used to control and synchronize the pace of operations. A higher clock speed enables more instructions to be executed in a given period of time. The unit of measurement of clock speed is the hertz ( Hz), with 1 Hz equaling 1 pulse per second. In the 1990s, computers mea-
sured clock speed in megahertz ( MHz, i.e., 1 million pulses per second), but CPU speed has 
been improving continuously; the clock speed of a computer is now usually stated in gigahertz (GHz, i.e., 1 billion pulses per second). Intel’s newest processors run at about 3 GHz.
CPUs were originally developed with only one core. The core is the part of the processor 
that performs the reading and executing of instructions. In order to increase the CPU pro-cessing power, chip manufacturers are now producing CPUs that contain multiple cores. A multicore CPU is a single component with two or more independent cores. Today’s consumer computers typically have two, four, and even eight separate cores. Soon, CPUs with dozens or even hundreds of cores will be affordable.
1.2.2 Bits and Bytes
Before we discuss memory, let’s look at how information (data and programs) are stored in a computer.
A computer is really nothing more than a series of switches. Each switch exists in two 
states: on or off. Storing information in a computer is simply a matter of setting a sequence of switches on or off. If the switch is on, its value is 1. If the switch is off, its value is 0. These 0s and 1s are interpreted as digits in the binary number system and are called bits (binary digits).
The minimum storage unit in a computer is a byte. A byte is composed of eight bits. A 
small number such as 
3 can be stored as a single byte. To store a number that cannot fit into a 
single byte, the computer uses several bytes.
Data of various kinds, such as numbers and characters, are encoded as a series of bytes. 
As a programmer, you don’t need to worry about the encoding and decoding of data, which the computer system performs automatically, based on the encoding scheme. An encoding scheme is a set of rules that govern how a computer translates characters and numbers into data with which the computer can actually work. Most schemes translate each character into

The central theme of this book is to learn how to solve problems by writing a program.
This book is about programming. So, what is programming? The term programming means to 
create (or develop) software, which is also called a program. In basic terms, software contains instructions that tell a computer—or a computerized device—what to do.
Software is all around you, even in devices you might not think would need it. Of course, 
you expect to find and use software on a personal computer, but software also plays a role in running airplanes, cars, cell phones, and even toasters. On a personal computer, you use word processors to write documents, web browsers to explore the Internet, and e-mail programs to send and receive messages. These programs are all examples of software. Software develop-ers create software with the help of powerful tools called programming languages.
This book teaches you how to create programs by using the Java programming language. 
There are many programming languages, some of which are decades old. Each language was invented for a specific purpose—to build on the strengths of a previous language, for exam-ple, or to give the programmer a new and unique set of tools. Knowing there are so many programming languages available, it would be natural for you to wonder which one is best. However, in truth, there is no “best” language. Each one has its own strengths and weak-nesses. Experienced programmers know one language might work well in some situations, whereas a different language may be more appropriate in other situations. For this reason, seasoned programmers try to master as many different programming languages as they can, giving them access to a vast arsenal of software-development tools.
If you learn to program using one language, you should find it easy to pick up other lan-
guages. The key is to learn how to solve problems using a programming approach. That is the main theme of this book.
You are about to begin an exciting journey: learning how to program. At the outset, it is 
helpful to review computer basics, programs, and operating systems (OSs). If you are already familiar with such terms as central processing unit (CPU), memory, disks, operating systems, and programming languages, you may skip Sections 1.2–1.4.
1.2 What Is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data.
A computer includes both hardware and software. In general, hardware comprises the visi-
ble, physical elements of the computer, and software provides the invisible instructions that 
control the hardware and make it perform specific tasks. Knowing computer hardware isn’t essential to learning a programming language, but it can help you better understand the ef-fects that a program’s instructions have on the computer and its components. This section introduces computer hardware components and their functions.
A computer consists of the following major hardware components (see Figure 1.1):
■■A central processing unit (CPU)
■■Memory (main memory)
■■Storage devices (such as disks and CDs)
■■Input devices (such as the mouse and the keyboard)
■■Output devices (such as monitors and printers)
■■Communication devices (such as modems and network interface cards (NIC))
A computer’s components are interconnected by a subsystem called a bus. You can think 
of a bus as a sort of system of roads running among the computer’s components; data and power travel along the bus from one part of the computer to another. In personal computers, PointKey

the parts of a computer together.

a predetermined string of bits. In the popular ASCII encoding scheme, for example, the char-
acter C is represented as 01000011  in 1 byte.
A computer’s storage capacity is measured in bytes and multiples of the byte, as follows:
■A kilobyte (KB) is about 1,000 bytes.
■A megabyte (MB) is about 1 million bytes.
■A gigabyte (GB) is about 1 billion bytes.
■A terabyte (TB) is about 1 trillion bytes.
A typical one-page word document might take 20 KB. Therefore, 1 MB can store 50 pages 
of documents, and 1 GB can store 50,000 pages of documents. A typical two-hour high-
 
resolution movie might take 8 GB, so it would require 160 GB to store 20 movies.
1.2.3  Memory
A computer’s memory consists of an ordered sequence of bytes for storing programs as well as data with which the program is working. You can think of memory as the computer’s work area for executing a program. A program and its data must be moved into the computer’s memory before they can be executed by the CPU.
Every byte in the memory has a unique address, as shown in Figure 1.2. The address is 
used to locate the byte for storing and retrieving the data. Since the bytes in the memory can be accessed in any order, the memory is also referred to as random-access memory (RAM).kilobyte (KB)

Figure  1.2 Memory stores data and program instructions in uniquely addressed memory 
locations.
Today’s personal computers usually have at least 4 GB of RAM, but they more commonly 
have 8 to 32 GB installed. Generally speaking, the more RAM a computer has, the faster it 
can operate, but there are limits to this simple rule of thumb.
A memory byte is never empty, but its initial content may be meaningless to your program. 
The current content of a memory byte is lost whenever new information is placed in it.
Like the CPU, memory is built on silicon semiconductor chips that have millions of tran
-
sistors embedded on their surface. Compared to CPU chips, memory chips are less compli-cated, slower, and less expensive.
1.2.4  Storage Devices
A computer’s memory (RAM) is a volatile form of data storage: Any information that has been saved in memory is lost when the system’s power is turned off. Programs and data are permanently stored on storage devices and are moved, when the computer actually uses them, to memory, which operates at much faster speeds than permanent storage devices can.
storage devices
M01_LIAN2079_12_GE_C01.indd   26 09/06/2021   13:001.2 What I s a Computer?  27
There are four main types of storage devices:
■Magnetic disk drives
■Optical disc drives (CD and DVD)
■Universal serial bus (USB) flash drives
■Cloud storage
Drives are devices for operating a medium, such as disks and CDs. A storage medium 
physically stores data and program instructions. The drive reads data from the medium and 
writes data onto the medium.
Disks
A computer usually has at least one hard disk drive. Hard disks are used for permanently storing data and programs. Newer computers have hard disks that can store from 1 terabyte of data to 4 terabytes of data. Hard disk drives are usually encased inside the computer, but removable hard disks are also available.
CDs and DVDs
CD stands for compact disc. There are three types of CDs: CD-ROM, CD-R, and CD-RW. A CD-ROM is a prepressed disc. It was popular for distributing software, music, and video. Software, music, and video are now increasingly distributed on the Internet without using CDs. A CD-R (CD-Recordable) is a write-once medium. It can be used to record data once and read any number of times. A CD-RW (CD-ReWritable) can be used like a hard disk; that is, you can write data onto the disc, then overwrite that data with new data. A single CD can hold up to 700 MB.
DVD stands for digital versatile disc or digital video disc. DVDs and CDs look alike, and 
you can use either to store data. A DVD can hold more information than a CD; a standard DVD’s storage capacity is 4.7 GB. There are two types of DVDs: DVD-R (Recordable) and DVD-RW (ReWritable).
USB Flash Drives
Universal serial bus (USB) connectors allow the user to attach many kinds of peripheral de-vices to the computer. You can use an USB to connect a printer, digital camera, mouse, exter-nal hard disk drive, and other devices to the computer.
An USB flash drive is a device for storing and transporting data. A flash drive is small—about 
the size of a pack of gum. It acts like a portable hard drive that can be plugged into your com-puter’s USB port. USB flash drives are currently available with up to 256 GB storage capacity.
Cloud Storage
Storing data on the cloud is becoming popular. Many companies provide cloud service on the Internet. For example, you can store Microsoft Office documents in Google Docs. Google Docs can be accessed from docs.google.com on the Chrome browser. The documents can be easily shared with others. Microsoft OneDrive is provided free to Windows user for storing files. The data stored in the cloud can be accessed from any device on the Internet.
1.2.5  Input and Output Devices
Input and output devices let the user communicate with the computer. The most common input devices are the keyboard and mouse. The most common output devices are monitors 
and printers.drive

area such as a school, a home, and an office. A high-speed NIC called 1000BaseT
can transfer data at 1,000 million bits per second (mbps).
■Wi-Fi, a special type of wireless networking, is common in homes, businesses, and schools to connect computers, phones, tablets, and printers to the Internet without the need for a physical wired connection.

1.3Programming Languages
Computer programs, known as software, are instructions that tell a computer what to do.
Computers do not understand human languages, so programs must be written in a language a 
computer can use. There are hundreds of programming languages, and they were developed to make the programming process easier for people. However, all programs must be con-verted into the instructions the computer can execute.
1.3.1 Machine Language
A computer’s native language, which differs among different types of computers, is its 
machine language
—a set of built-in primitive instructions. These instructions are in the form 
of binary code, so if you want to give a computer an instruction in its native language, you have to enter the instruction as binary code. For example, to add two numbers, you might have to write an instruction in binary code as follows:
1101101010011010
1.3.2 Assembly Language
Programming in machine language is a tedious process. Moreover, programs written in ma-chine language are very difficult to read and modify. For this reason, assembly language was created in the early days of computing as an alternative to machine languages. Assembly language uses a short descriptive word, known as a mnemonic, to represent each of the 
machine-language instructions. For example, the mnemonic add typically means to add num-
bers, and sub means to subtract numbers. To add the numbers 2 and 3 and get the result, you 
might write an instruction in assembly code as follows:
add 2, 3, result
Assembly languages were developed to make programming easier. However, because 
the computer cannot execute assembly language, another program—called an assembler—is used to translate assembly-language programs into machine code, as shown in Figure 1.3.
Writing code in assembly language is easier than in machine language. However, it is still 
tedious to write code in assembly language. An instruction in assembly language essentially network interface card (NIC)

assemblerThe Keyboard
A keyboard is a device for entering input. Compact keyboards are available without a nu-
meric keypad.
Function keys are located across the top of the keyboard and are prefaced with the letter F. 
Their functions depend on the software currently being used.
A modifier key is a special key (such as the Shift, Alt, and Ctrl keys) that modifies the nor-
mal action of another key when the two are pressed simultaneously.
The numeric keypad, located on the right side of most keyboards, is a separate set of keys 
styled like a calculator to use for quickly entering numbers.
Arrow keys, located between the main keypad and the numeric keypad, are used to move 
the mouse pointer up, down, left, and right on the screen in many kinds of programs.
The Insert, Delete, Page Up, and Page Down keys are used in word processing and other 
programs for inserting text and objects, deleting text and objects, and moving up or down through a document one screen at a time.
The Mouse
A mouse is a pointing device. It is used to move a graphical pointer (usually in the shape of 
an arrow) called a cursor around the screen, or to click on-screen objects (such as a button) to trigger them to perform an action.
The Monitor
The monitor displays information (text and graphics). The screen resolution and dot pitch 
determine the quality of the display.
The screen resolution specifies the number of pixels in horizontal and vertical dimensions of the 
display device. Pixels (short for “picture elements”) are tiny dots that form an image on the screen. A common resolution for a 17-inch screen, for example, is 1,024 pixels wide and 768 pixels high. The resolution can be set manually. The higher the resolution, the sharper and clearer the image is.
The dot pitch is the amount of space between pixels, measured in millimeters. The smaller 
the dot pitch, the sharper is the display.
Touchscreens
The cellphones, tablets, appliances, electronic voting machines, as well as some computers use touchscreens. A touchscreen is integrated with a monitor to enable users to enter input and control the display using a finger.
1.2.6  Communication Devices
Computers can be networked through communication devices, such as a dial-up modem 
 (
modulator/demodulator), a digital subscriber line (DSL) or cable modem, a wired network 
interface card, or a wireless adapter.
■A dial-up modem uses a phone line to dial a phone number to connect to the Internet
and can transfer data at a speed up to 56,000 bps (bits per second).
■A digital subscriber line (DSL) connection also uses a standard phone line, but it can
transfer data 20 times faster than a standard dial-up modem. Dial-up modem wasused in the 90s and is now replaced by DSL and cable modem.
■A cable modem uses the cable line maintained by the cable company and is generally
faster than DSL.
■A network interface card (NIC) is a device that connects a computer to a local area
network (LAN). LANs are commonly used to connect computers within a limitedfunction key

corresponds to an instruction in machine code. Writing in assembly language requires that 
you know how the CPU works. Assembly language is referred to as a low-level language, because assembly language is close in nature to machine language and is machine dependent.
1.3.3 High-Level Language
In the 1950s, a new generation of programming languages known as high-level languages emerged. They are platform independent, which means that you can write a program in a high-level language and run it in different types of machines. High-level languages are similar to English and easy to learn and use. The instructions in a high-level programming language are called statements. Here, for example, is a high-level language statement that computes the area of a circle with a radius of 
5:
area = 5 * 5 * 3.14159;
There are many high-level programming languages, and each was designed for a specific 
purpose. Table 1.1 lists some popular ones.low-level language

Figure  1.3 An assembler translates assembly-language instructions into machine code.
A program written in a high-level language is called a source program or source code. 
Because a computer cannot execute a source program, a source program must be translated 
into machine code for execution. The translation can be done using another programming tool called an interpreter or a compiler.source program

The operating system (OS) is the most important program that runs on a computer. 
The OS manages and controls a computer’s activities.
The popular operating systems for general-purpose computers are Microsoft Windows, Mac 
OS, and Linux. Application programs, such as a web browser or a word processor, cannot run unless an operating system is installed and running on the computer. Figure 1.5 shows the interrelationship of hardware, operating system, application software, and the user.PointKey

The major tasks of an operating system are as follows:
■■Controlling and monitoring system activities
■■Allocating and assigning system resources
■■Scheduling operations
1.4.1 Controlling and Monitoring System Activities
Operating systems perform basic tasks, such as recognizing input from the keyboard, sending 
output to the monitor, keeping track of files and folders on storage devices, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers. An operating system must also ensure different programs and users working at the same time do not interfere with each other. In addition, the OS is responsible for security, ensuring unauthorized users and programs are not allowed to access the system.
1.4.2 Allocating and Assigning System Resources
The operating system is responsible for determining what computer resources a program needs (such as CPU time, memory space, disks, and input and output devices) and for allocat-ing and assigning them to run the program.
1.4.3 Scheduling Operations
The OS is responsible for scheduling programs’ activities to make efficient use of system resources. Many of today’s operating systems support techniques such as multiprogramming, multithreading, and multiprocessing to increase system performance.
Multiprogramming allows multiple programs such as Microsoft Word, E-mail, and web 
browser to run simultaneously by sharing the same CPU. The CPU is much faster than the computer’s other components. As a result, it is idle most of the time—for example, while waiting for data to be transferred from a disk or waiting for other system resources to respond. A multiprogramming OS takes advantage of this situation by allowing multiple programs to use the CPU when it would otherwise be idle. For example, multiprogramming enables you to use a word processor to edit a file at the same time as your web browser is downloading a file.
Multithreading allows a single program to execute multiple tasks at the same time. For 
instance, a word-processing program allows users to simultaneously edit text and save it to a disk. In this example, editing and saving are two tasks within the same program. These two tasks may run concurrently.
Multiprocessing is similar to multithreading. The difference is that multithreading is for 
running multithreads concurrently within one program, but multiprocessing is for running multiple programs concurrently using multiple processors.

1.5 Java, the World Wide Web, and Beyond
Java is a powerful and versatile programming language for developing software run-ning on mobile devices, desktop computers, and servers.
This book introduces Java programming. Java was developed by a team led by James Gosling 
at Sun Microsystems. Sun Microsystems was purchased by Oracle in 2010. Originally called Oak, Java was designed in 1991 for use in embedded chips in consumer electronic appliances. multiprogramming

M01_LIAN2079_12_GE_C01.indd   32 09/06/2021   13:00In 1995, renamed Java, it was redesigned for developing web applications. For the history of 
Java, see www.java.com/en/javahistory/index.jsp.
Java has become enormously popular. Its rapid rise and wide acceptance can be traced to its de-
sign characteristics, particularly its promise that you can write a program once and run it  anywhere. 
As stated by its designer, Java is simple, object oriented, distributed,  interpreted, robust, secure, 
architecture neutral, portable, high performance, multithreaded, and dynamic. For the anatomy of 
Java characteristics, see liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/etc/JavaCharacteristics.pdf.
Java is a full-featured, general-purpose programming language that can be used to develop 
robust mission-critical applications. It is employed not only on desktop computers, but also on servers and mobile devices. Today, more than 3 billion devices run Java. Most major companies use Java in some applications. Most server-side applications were developed using Java. Java was used to develop the code to communicate with and control the robotic rover on Mars. The software for Android cell phones is developed using Java.
Java initially became attractive because Java programs can run from a web browser. Such 
programs are called applets. Today applets are no longer allowed to run from a Web browser due to security issues. Java, however, is now very popular for developing applications on web servers. These applications process data, perform computations, and generate dynamic web-pages. Many commercial Websites are developed using Java on the backend.

1.6  The Java Language Specification, API, JDK,  
JRE, and IDE
Java syntax is defined in the Java language specification, and the Java library is de-
fined in the Java application program interface (API). The JDK is the software for compiling and running Java programs. An IDE is an integrated development environ-ment for rapidly developing programs.
Computer languages have strict rules of usage. If you do not follow the rules when writing a 
program, the computer will not be able to understand it. The Java language specification and the Java API define the Java standards.
The Java language specification is a technical definition of the Java programming 
 language’s syntax and semantics. You can find the complete Java language specification at 
docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/.
The application program interface (API), also known as library, contains predefined 
classes and interfaces for developing Java programs. The API is still expanding. You can view the latest Java API documentation at https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/.
Java is a full-fledged and powerful language that can be used in many ways. It comes in 
three editions:
■■Java Standard Edition (Java SE) to develop client-side applications. The applica-tions can run on desktop.
■■Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) to develop server-side applications, such as Java servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and JavaServer Faces (JSF).
■■Java Micro Edition (Java ME) to develop applications for mobile devices, such as cell phones.
This book uses Java SE to introduce Java programming. Java SE is the foundation upon 
which all other Java technology is based. There are many versions of Java SE. The latest, PointCheck

the word after class  is the name for the class. Other keywords in this program are public , 
static , and void .
Line 3 is a comment that documents what the program is and how it is constructed. 
Comments help programmers to communicate and understand the program. They are not pro-
gramming statements, and thus are ignored by the compiler. In Java, comments are preceded by two slashes (
//) on a line, called a line comment, or enclosed between /* and */ on one or 
several lines, called a block comment or paragraph comment. When the compiler sees //, it 
ignores all text after // on the same line. When it sees /*, it scans for the next */ and ignores 
any text between /* and */. Here are examples of comments:
// This application program displays Welcome to Java!
/* This application program displays Welcome to Java! */
/* This application program
   displays Welcome to Java! */
A pair of braces in a program forms a block that groups the program’s components. In 
Java, each block begins with an opening brace ( {) and ends with a closing brace ( }). Every 
class has a class block that groups the data and methods of the class. Similarly, every method 
has a method block that groups the statements in the method. Blocks can be nested, meaning 
that one block can be placed within another, as shown in the following code:

case sensitiveJava SE 11 (or simply Java 11), is used in this book. Oracle releases each version with a Java 
Development Toolkit (JDK). For Java 11, the Java Development Toolkit is called JDK 11.
The JDK consists of a set of separate programs, each invoked from a command line, for 
compiling, running, and testing Java programs. The program for running Java programs is known as Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Instead of using the JDK, you can use a Java de-velopment tool (e.g., NetBeans, Eclipse, and TextPad)—software that provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing Java programs quickly. Editing, compiling, building, debugging, and online help are integrated in one graphical user interface. You sim-ply enter source code in one window or open an existing file in a window, and then click a button or menu item or press a function key to compile and run the program.

1.7 A Simple Java Program
A Java program is executed from the main  method in the class.
Let’s begin with a simple Java program that displays the message Welcome to Java!  
on the console. (The word console is an old computer term that refers to the text entry and display device of a computer. Console input means to receive input from the keyboard, and console output means to display output on the monitor.) The program is given in Listing 1.1.
LisTing  1.1 Welcome.java
1  public class Welcome {
2    public static void main(String[] args) {

Note the line numbers are for reference purposes only; they are not part of the program. 
So, don’t type line numbers in your program.
Line 1 defines a class. Every Java program must have at least one class. Each class has a 
name. By convention, class names start with an uppercase letter. In this example, the class 
name is Welcome .
Line 2 defines the main  method. The program is executed from the main  method. A class 
may contain several methods. The main  method is the entry point where the program begins 
execution.
A method is a construct that contains statements. The main  method in this program con-
tains the System.out.println  statement. This statement displays the string Welcome to 
Java!  on the console (line 4). String is a programming term meaning a sequence of charac-
ters. A string must be enclosed in double quotation marks. Every statement in Java ends with a semicolon (
;), known as the statement terminator.
Keywords have a specific meaning to the compiler and cannot be used for other purposes 
in the program. For example, when the compiler sees the word class , it understands that line numbers

Comments help programmers to communicate and understand the program. They are not pro-
gramming statements, and thus are ignored by the compiler. In Java, comments are preceded by two slashes (
//) on a line, called a line comment, or enclosed between /* and */ on one or 
several lines, called a block comment or paragraph comment. When the compiler sees //, it 
ignores all text after // on the same line. When it sees /*, it scans for the next */ and ignores 
any text between /* and */. Here are examples of comments:

A pair of braces in a program forms a block that groups the program’s components. In 
Java, each block begins with an opening brace ( {) and ends with a closing brace ( }). Every 
class has a class block that groups the data and methods of the class. Similarly, every method 
has a method block that groups the statements in the method. Blocks can be nested, meaning

Tip
An opening brace must be matched by a closing brace. Whenever you type an opening 
brace, immediately type a closing brace to prevent the missing-brace error. Most Java IDEs automatically insert the closing brace for each opening brace.
Caution
Java source programs are case sensitive. It would be wrong, for example, to replace main in the program with Main.
You have seen several special characters (e.g., { }, //, ;) in the program. They are 
used in almost every program. Table 1.2 summarizes their uses.
The most common errors you will make as you learn to program will be syntax errors. 
Like any programming language, Java has its own syntax, and you need to write code that 
conforms to the syntax rules. If your program violates a rule—for example, if the semicolon is missing, a brace is missing, a quotation mark is missing, or a word is misspelled—the Java special characters

the compiler reports.
Note
You are probably wondering why the main  method is defined this way and why 
System.out.println(...)  is used to display a message on the console. For the 
time being, simply accept that this is how things are done. Your questions will be fully 
answered in subsequent chapters.
The program in Listing 1.1 displays one message. Once you understand the program, it 
is easy to extend it to display more messages. For example, you can rewrite the program to display three messages, as shown in Listing 1.2.

Further, you can perform mathematical computations and display the result on the console.

45-3.5.
LisTing  1.3 ComputeExpression.java
1  public class ComputeExpression {
2    public static void main(String[] args) {
3      System.out.print( "(10.5 + 2 * 3) / (45 – 3.5) = " );

The print  method in line 3
System.out.print( "(10.5 + 2 * 3) / (45 – 3.5) = " );
is identical to the println  method except that println  moves to the beginning of the next 
line after displaying the string, but print  does not advance to the next line when completed.

  }}
1.8 Creating, Compiling, and Executing a Java Program
You save a Java program in a .java file and compile it into a .class file. The .class file 
is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
You have to create your program and compile it before it can be executed. This process is 
repetitive, as shown in Figure 1.6. If your program has compile errors, you have to modify the program to fix them, then recompile it. If your program has runtime errors or does not produce the correct result, you have to modify the program, recompile it, and execute it again.
You can use any text editor or IDE to create and edit a Java source-code file. This sec-
tion demonstrates how to create, compile, and run Java programs from a command window. Sections 1.11 and 1.12 will introduce developing Java programs using NetBeans and Eclipse. 
From the command window, you can use a text editor such as Notepad to create the Java source-code file, as shown in Figure 1.7.PointKey

Note
The source file must end with the extension .java  and must have the same exact 
name as the public class name. For example, the file for the source code in Listing 1.1 
should be named Welcome.java, since the public class name is Welcome .
A Java compiler translates a Java source file into a Java bytecode file. The following com-
mand compiles Welcome.java:
javac Welcome.java
Note
You must first install and configure the JDK before you can compile and run programs. 
See Supplement I.A, Installing and Configuring JDK 11, for how to install the JDK and set up the environment to compile and run Java programs. If you have trouble compil-
ing and running programs, see Supplement I.B, Compiling and Running Java from the 
Command Window. This supplement also explains how to use basic DOS commands and how to use Windows Notepad to create and edit files. All the supplements are accessible from the Companion Website.
If there aren’t any syntax errors, the compiler generates a bytecode file with a .class  
extension. Thus, the preceding command generates a file named Welcome.class, as shown in 
Figure 1.8a. The Java language is a high-level language, but Java bytecode is a low-level lan-
guage. The bytecode is similar to machine instructions but is architecture neutral and can run 
on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), as shown in Figure 1.8b. Rather than a physical machine, the virtual machine is a program that interprets Java bytecode. This is one of Java’s primary advantages: Java bytecode can run on a variety of hardware platforms and operating systems. Java source code is compiled into Java bytecode, and Java bytecode is interpreted by the JVM. Your Java code may use the code in the Java library. The JVM executes your code along with the code in the library.file name Welcome.java,

To execute a Java program is to run the program’s bytecode. You can execute the bytecode 
on any platform with a JVM, which is an interpreter. It translates the individual instructions 
in the bytecode into the target machine language code one at a time, rather than the whole program as a single unit. Each step is executed immediately after it is translated.
The following command runs the bytecode for Listing 1.1:
java Welcome
Figure 1.9 shows the javac  command for compiling Welcome.java. The compiler gener-
ates the Welcome.class file, and this file is executed using the java  command.

Caution
Do not use the extension .class  in the command line when executing the program. Use 
java ClassName  to run the program. If you use java ClassName.class  in the 
command line, the system will attempt to fetch ClassName.class.class .
Note
In JDK 11, you can use java ClassName.java  to compile and run a single-file 
source code program. This command combines compiling and running in one com-
mand. A single-file source code program contains only one class in the file. This is the 
case for all of our programs in the first eight chapters.
Tip
If you execute a class file that does not exist, a NoClassDefFoundError  will occur. 
If you execute a class file that does not have a main  method or you mistype the main  
method (e.g., by typing Main  instead of main ), a NoSuchMethodError  will occur.
Note
When executing a Java program, the JVM first loads the bytecode of the class to 
memory using a program called the class loader. If your program uses other classes, the class loader dynamically loads them just before they are needed. After a class is 
loaded, the JVM uses a program called the bytecode verifier to check the validity of the java ClassName

bytecode and to ensure that the bytecode does not violate Java’s security restrictions. 
Java enforces strict security to make sure Java class files are not tampered with and do not harm your computer.

Your instructor may require you to use packages for organizing programs. For example, you may place all programs in this chapter in a package named chapter 1. For instruc-

1.9 Programming Style and Documentation
Good programming style and proper documentation make a program easy to read and help programmers prevent errors.
Programming style deals with what programs look like. A program can compile and run 
properly even if written on only one line, but writing it all on one line would be a bad pro-gramming style because it would be hard to read. Documentation is the body of explanatory remarks and comments pertaining to a program. Programming style and documentation are as important as coding. Good programming style and appropriate documentation reduce the chance of errors and make programs easy to read. This section gives several guidelines. For more detailed guidelines, see Supplement I.C, Java Coding Style Guidelines, on the Companion Website.
1.9.1 Appropriate Comments and Comment Styles
Include a summary at the beginning of the program that explains what the program does, its key features, and any unique techniques it uses. In a long program, you should also include com-ments that introduce each major step and explain anything that is difficult to read. It is important to make comments concise so that they do not crowd the program or make it difficult to read.
In addition to line comments (beginning with 
//) and block comments (beginning with /*),  
Java supports comments of a special type, referred to as javadoc comments. javadoc com-ments begin with 
/** and end with */. They can be extracted into an HTML file using the 
JDK’s javadoc  command. For more information, see Supplement III.X, javadoc Comments, 
on the Companion Website.
Use javadoc comments ( /** . . . */ ) for commenting on an entire class or an entire 
method. These comments must precede the class or the method header in order to be extracted into a javadoc HTML file. For commenting on steps inside a method, use line comments (
//). To see 
an example of a javadoc HTML file, check out liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/javadoc/Exercise1.html. Its corresponding Java code is shown in liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/javadoc/Exercise1.txt.use package

1.9.2 Proper Indentation and Spacing
A consistent indentation style makes programs clear and easy to read, debug, and maintain. 
Indentation is used to illustrate the structural relationships between a program’s components or statements. Java can read the program even if all of the statements are on the same long line, but humans find it easier to read and maintain code that is aligned properly. Indent each subcomponent or statement at least two spaces more than the construct within which it is nested.
A single space should be added on both sides of a binary operator, as shown in (a), rather 
in (b).
System.out.println( 3 + 4 * 4); System.out.println( 3+4*4);
(a) Good style (b) Bad style
1.9.3 Block Styles
A block is a group of statements surrounded by braces. There are two popular styles, next-line 
style and end-of-line style, as shown below.
public class  Test
{
  public static void  main(String[] args)
  {    System.out.println(
"Block Styles" );
  }}public class  Test {
  public static void  main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println( "Block Styles" );
  }}
Next-line style End-of-line style
The next-line style aligns braces vertically and makes programs easy to read, whereas the 
end-of-line style saves space and may help avoid some subtle programming errors. Both are 
acceptable block styles. The choice depends on personal or organizational preference. You should use a block style consistently—mixing styles is not recommended. This book uses the end-of-line style to be consistent with the Java API source code.
1.9.1 Reformat the following program according to the programming style and documen-tation guidelines. Use the end-of-line brace style.
public class Test
{
  // Main method
public static void main(String[] args) {
  /** Display output */
  System.out.println( "Welcome to Java" );
  }}
1.10 Programming Errors
Programming errors can be categorized into three types: syntax errors, runtime  
errors, and logic errors.
1.10.1 Syntax Errors
Errors that are detected by the compiler are called syntax errors or compile errors.  Syntax 
errors result from errors in code construction, such as mistyping a keyword, omitting some necessary punctuation, or using an opening brace without a corresponding closing brace. indent code

These errors are usually easy to detect because the compiler tells you where they are and 
what caused them. For example, the program in Listing 1.4 has a syntax error, as shown in Figure 1.10.

3      System.out.println( "Welcome to Java );
4    }5  }
Four errors are reported, but the program actually has two errors:
■■The keyword void  is missing before main  in line 2.
■■The string Welcome to Java  should be closed with a closing quotation mark in 
line 3.
Since a single error will often display many lines of compile errors, it is a good practice 
to fix errors from the top line and work downward. Fixing errors that occur earlier in the pro-
gram may also fix additional errors that occur later.
Compile
Figure  1.10 The compiler reports syntax errors.
Tip
If you don’t know how to correct an error, compare your program closely, character by 
character, with similar examples in the text. In the first few weeks of this course, you will probably spend a lot of time fixing syntax errors. Soon you will be familiar with Java 
syntax, and can quickly fix syntax errors.
1.10.2 Runtime Errors
Runtime errors are errors that cause a program to terminate abnormally. They occur while 
a program is running if the environment detects an operation that is impossible to carry out. Input mistakes typically cause runtime errors. An input error occurs when the program is waiting for the user to enter a value, but the user enters a value that the program cannot han-dle. For instance, if the program expects to read in a number, but instead the user enters a string, this causes data-type errors to occur in the program.fix syntax errors
runtime errors

Another example of runtime errors is division by zero. This happens when the divisor is 
zero for integer divisions. For instance, the program in Listing 1.5 would cause a runtime 
error, as shown in Figure 1.11.
LisTing  1.5 ShowRuntimeErrors.java
1  public class ShowRuntimeErrors {
2    public static void main(String[] args) {
3      System.out.println( 1 / 0);
4    }5  } runtime error
Run
Figure  1.11 The runtime error causes the program to terminate abnormally.
1.10.3 Logic Errors
Logic errors occur when a program does not perform the way it was intended to. Errors of 
this kind occur for many different reasons. For example, suppose you wrote the program in Listing 1.6 to convert Celsius 
35 degrees to a Fahrenheit degree:
LisTing  1.6 ShowLogicErrors.java
1  public class ShowLogicErrors {
2    public static void main(String[] args) {
3      System.out.print( "Celsius 35 is Fahrenheit degree " );
4      System.out.println(( 9 / 5) * 35 + 32);
5    }6  }logic errors
You will get Fahrenheit 67 degrees, which is wrong. It should be 95.0 . In Java, the divi-
sion for integers is the quotient—the fractional part is truncated—so in Java 9 / 5  is 1. To 
get the correct result, you need to use 9.0 / 5 , which results in 1.8.
In general, syntax errors are easy to find and easy to correct because the compiler gives 
indications as to where the errors came from and why they are wrong. Runtime errors are 
not difficult to find, either, since the reasons and locations for the errors are displayed on the console when the program aborts. Finding logic errors, on the other hand, can be very challenging. In the upcoming chapters, you will learn the techniques of tracing programs and finding logic errors.
1.10.4 Common Errors
Missing a closing brace, missing a semicolon, missing quotation marks for strings, and mis-spelling names are common errors for new programmers.Celsius 35 is Fahrenheit degree 67
M01_LIAN2079_12_GE_C01.indd   43 09/06/2021   13:0044  Chapter 1  Introduction to Computers, Programs, and Java™
Common Error 1: Missing Braces
The braces are used to denote a block in the program. Each opening brace must be matched 
by a closing brace. A common error is missing the closing brace. To avoid this error, type a closing brace whenever an opening brace is typed, as shown in the following example:
public class Welcome {
} Type this closing brace right aw ay to match th e
opening brace
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Programming is fun!");
System.out.println("Fundamentals First");
System.out.println("Problem Driven")
}
Missing a semicolon
System.out.println("Problem Driven );
Missing a quotation mark
public class Test {
  public static void Main(string[] args) {
    System.out.println((10.5 + 2 * 3) / (45 - 3.5 ));
  }
}If you use an IDE such as NetBeans and Eclipse, the IDE automatically inserts a closing 
brace for each opening brace typed.
Common Error 2: Missing Semicolons
Each statement ends with a statement terminator (;). Often, a new programmer forgets to place 
a statement terminator for the last statement in a block, as shown in the following example:
Common Error 3: Missing Quotation Marks
A string must be placed inside the quotation marks. Often, a new programmer forgets to place 
a quotation mark at the end of a string, as shown in the following example:
If you use an IDE such as NetBeans and Eclipse, the IDE automatically inserts a closing 
quotation mark for each opening quotation mark typed.
Common Error 4: Misspelling Names
Java is case sensitive. Misspelling names is a common error for new programmers. For ex-
ample, the word main  is misspelled as Main  and String  is misspelled as string  in the 
following code:

1.10.2 Give examples of syntax errors, runtime errors, and logic errors.
1.10.3 If you forget to put a closing quotation mark on a string, what kind of error will be raised?
1.10.4 If your program needs to read integers, but the user entered strings, an error would occur when running this program. What kind of error is this?
1.10.5 Suppose you write a program for computing the perimeter of a rectangle and you mistak-enly write your program so it computes the area of a rectangle. What kind of error is this?PointCheck

1.11 Developing Java Programs Using NetBeans
You can edit, compile, run, and debug Java Programs using NetBeans.
Note
Section 1.8 introduced developing programs from the command line. Many of our 
 readers also use an IDE. This section and next section introduce two most popular Java 
IDEs: NetBeans and Eclipse. These two sections may be skipped.
NetBeans and Eclipse are two free popular integrated development environments for developing 
Java programs. They are easy to learn if you follow simple instructions. We recommend that you use either one for developing Java programs. This section gives the essential instructions to guide new users to create a project, create a class, compile, and run a class in NetBeans. The use of Eclipse will be introduced in the next section. To use JDK 11, you need NetBeans 9 or higher. For instructions on downloading and installing latest version of NetBeans, see Supplement II.B.
1.11.1 Creating a Java Project

Note
The above terms are defined in this chapter. Glossary (at the end of TOC) lists all the 
key terms and descriptions in the book, organized by chapters.
ChapTer  summary
1. A computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data.
2. A computer includes both hardware and software.
3. Hardware is the physical aspect of the computer that can be touched.
4. Computer programs, known as software, are the invisible instructions that control the 
hardware and make it perform tasks.
5. Computer programming is the writing of instructions (i.e., code) for computers to 
perform.
6. The central processing unit (CPU) is a computer’s brain. It retrieves instructions from 
memory and executes them.
7. Computers use zeros and ones because digital devices have two stable states, referred to 
by convention as zero and one.
8. A bit is a binary digit 0 or 1.
9. A byte is a sequence of 8 bits.
10. A kilobyte is about 1,000 bytes, a megabyte about 1 million bytes, a gigabyte about 1 billion bytes, and a terabyte about 1,000 gigabytes.
11. Memory stores data and program instructions for the CPU to execute.
12. A memory unit is an ordered sequence of bytes.
13. Memory is volatile, because information is lost when the power is turned off.
14. Programs and data are permanently stored on storage devices and are moved to memory 
when the computer actually uses them.
15. The machine language is a set of primitive instructions built into every computer.
16. Assembly language is a low-level programming language in which a mnemonic is used to represent each machine-language instruction.
17. High-level languages are English-like and easy to learn and program.
18. A program written in a high-level language is called a source program.
19. A compiler is a software program that translates the source program into a machine- 
language program.
20. The operating system (OS) is a program that manages and controls a computer’s 
activities.Supplement I.A

21. Java is platform independent, meaning you can write a program once and run it on any 
computer.
22. The Java source file name must match the public class name in the program. Java source-code files must end with the 
.java  extension.
23. Every class is compiled into a separate bytecode file that has the same name as the class and ends with the 
.class  extension.
24. To compile a Java source-code file from the command line, use the javac  command.
25. To run a Java class from the command line, use the java  command.
26. Every Java program is a set of class definitions. The keyword class  introduces a class 
definition. The contents of the class are included in a block.
27. A block begins with an opening brace ( {) and ends with a closing brace ( }).
28. Methods are contained in a class. To run a Java program, the program must have a 
main  method. The main  method is the entry point where the program starts when it is 
executed.
29. Every statement in Java ends with a semicolon ( ;), known as the statement terminator.
30. Keywords have a specific meaning to the compiler and cannot be used for other pur -
poses in the program.
31. In Java, comments are preceded by two slashes ( //) on a line, called a line comment, or 
enclosed between /* and */ on one or several lines, called a block comment or para-
graph comment. Comments are ignored by the compiler.
32. Java source programs are case sensitive.
33. Programming errors can be categorized into three types: syntax errors, runtime  
errors, and logic errors. Errors reported by a compiler are called syntax errors  
or compile errors. Runtime errors are errors that cause a program to terminate ab-
normally. Logic errors occur when a program does not perform the way it was intended to.

 *1.11 (Population projection) The U.S. Census Bureau projects population based on 
the following assumptions:
■■One birth every 7 seconds
■■One death every 13 seconds
■■One new immigrant every 45 seconds
Write a program to display the population for each of the next five years. Assume that the current population is 312,032,486, and one year has 365 days. Hint: In Java, if two integers perform division, the result is an integer. The fractional part is trun-cated. For example, 
5 / 4 is 1 (not 1.25 ) and 10 / 4 is 2 (not 2.5). To get an accu-
rate result with the fractional part, one of the values involved in the division must be a number with a decimal point. For example, 
5.0 / 4 is 1.25  and 10 / 4.0 is 2.5.
 1.12 (Average speed in kilometers) Assume that a runner runs 24 miles in 1 hour, 40
