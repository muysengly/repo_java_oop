---

## 1.7. A Simple Java Program

---

### Structure of a Java Program

**Example:**

```java
public class Welcome {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
    }
}
```

```java
public class Welcome {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

- The program is saved in a file named `Welcome.java`.

- The program defines a class named `Welcome` with a `main` method that prints "Welcome to Java!" on the console.

- The `System.out.println` statement displays the message.

---

### Class Definition

- Every Java program must have at least one class, and each class has a name.

- The class is defined using the `class` keyword.

---

### Main Method

- The entry point for the program is the `main` method.

- The main method is defined as `public static void main(String[] args)`.

---

### Statements and Syntax

- **`System.out.println`**: This method is used to display messages on the console. In the example, it prints "Welcome to Java!".

- **`String`**: A sequence of characters enclosed in double quotation marks.

- **Statement Terminator**: Every statement in Java ends with a semicolon (`;`).

---

### Comments

- **Line Comments**: Use `//` to denote comments on a single line.

- **Block Comments**: Enclosed between `/*` and `*/`, used for comments spanning multiple lines.

---

### Special Characters

<img src="./images\image-20250308033312779.png" alt="image-20250308033312779" />

---

**Explain:**

- `{}`: Used to enclose blocks of code.

- `()` and `[]`: Used for method parameters and array indices, respectively.

- `;`: Statement terminator.

- `//`: Line comment.

- `/* */`: Block comment.

---

### Keywords

**Keywords** are reserved words in Java that have specific meanings and cannot be used for other purposes.

**List of Keywords:**

`abstract`, `assert`, `boolean`, `break`, `byte`, `case`, `catch`, `char`, `class`, `const`, `continue`, `default`, `do`, `double`, `else`, `enum`, `extends`, `final`, `finally`, `float`, `for`, `goto`, `if`, `implements`, `import`, `instanceof`, `int`, `interface`, `long`, `native`, `new`, `package`, `private`, `protected`, `public`, `return`, `short`, `static`, `strictfp`, `super`, `switch`, `synchronized`, `this`, `throw`, `throws`, `transient`, `try`, `void`, `volatile`, `while`, `true`, `false`, `null`, etc.

---

### Case Sensitivity

- Java is case-sensitive, meaning that keywords, class names, and other identifiers must be used with consistent capitalization.

**Example:**

- `System.out.println` is different from `system.out.println`.

- `Welcome` is different from `welcome`.

- `main` is different from `Main`.

- `String` is different from `string`.

- `public` is different from `Public`.

- `class` is different from `Class`.

- `println` is different from `Println`.

---

### Common Errors

- **Syntax Errors**: These occur when the program violates Java's syntax rules (e.g., missing semicolon, unmatched braces).

- **Compile Errors**: The compiler detects syntax errors and provides error messages indicating the problem.

---

## 1.8. Creating, Compiling, and Executing a Java Program

---

### Architecture of a Java Program

<img src="./images\image-20250307133653645.png" alt="image-20250307133653645" style="zoom: 80%;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color:white;" />

---

### Writing Source Code

Source code is written in a `.java` file using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

**Example: `Welcome.java`**

```java
public class Welcome {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
    }
}
```

---

### Compiling

- `javac` is the Java compiler that translates Java source code into Java bytecode.

- Use the `javac` command to compile the source code into a bytecode file with a `.class` extension.

- The compiler checks the source code for syntax errors and generates bytecode if the code is error-free.

**Example:** `javac Welcome.java` compiles `Welcome.java` and creates `Welcome.class`.

---

### Bytecode

- Java source code is translated into Java bytecode, a low-level language similar to machine instructions.

- Bytecode is platform-independent and can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

**Example:** `Welcome.class` (Bytecode)

---

### Running Bytecode

- `java` is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that executes Java bytecode.

- Use the `java` command to run the bytecode.

- The JVM loads the bytecode file and executes the program.

**Example:**

`java Welcome` runs the `Welcome.class` file.

- Bytecode is executed by the JVM, which interprets the individual instructions and translates them into the target machine language.

---

### Handling Errors

- If compile errors occur, modify the source code and recompile.

- If runtime errors or incorrect results occur, modify the source code, recompile, and run the bytecode again.

---

### JVM

- The JVM is a program that interprets Java bytecode.

- JVM dynamically loads necessary classes and verifies bytecode for security.

---

### IDE

- **VS Code**: A lightweight code editor with support for Java development.

- **NetBeans**: An IDE with features like code completion, debugging, and project management.

- **Eclipse**: A popular Java IDE with a wide range of plugins and tools.

- **IntelliJ** **IDEA**: A powerful IDE with advanced features for Java development.

---

## 1.9. Programming Style and Documentation

---

### Good Programming Style

- Ensure your programs are easy to read and understand.

- Use consistent formatting, including indentation and spacing.

- Align your code structure clearly, making the relationships between different parts obvious.

---

### Appropriate Comments and Comment Styles

- Include a summary at the beginning of the program explaining what it does, its key features, and any unique techniques.

- Use comments to introduce each major step and explain complex code sections.

- Make comments concise and avoid cluttering the program.

---

### Types of Comments

- **Line Comments**: Start with `//` for single-line comments.

- **Block Comments**: Enclosed between `/*` and `*/` for multi-line comments.

- **Javadoc Comments**: Begin with `/**` and end with `*/`, used for class-level and method-level comments.

---

**Example:** Line Comments

```java
// This program displays a welcome message.
public class Welcome {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Display the message
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

- The line comment `// This program displays a welcome message.` provides a brief summary of the program.

- The line comment `// Display the message` explains the purpose of the `System.out.println` statement.

---

**Example:** Javadoc Comments

```java
/**
 * The Welcome class displays a welcome message.
 */
public class Welcome {
    /**
     * The main method prints the welcome message.
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Display the message
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

- The Javadoc comment `/** ... */` provides a detailed description of the class and method.

- The Javadoc comment `/** ... */` is used for generating documentation.

---

### Proper Indentation and Spacing

- Indentation helps illustrate the structural relationships between program components.

- Indent at least two spaces for each subcomponent.

- Add a single space on both sides of binary operators for readability.

---

### Block Styles

- Blocks are groups of statements surrounded by braces `{}`.

- Two popular styles:

  - **Next-Line Style**: Align braces vertically.
  - **End-of-Line Style**: Place opening brace at the end of a line.

- Choose one style and use it consistently throughout your program.

---

**Example**: Next-Line Style

```java
// Next-Line Style
public class Welcome
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
    }
}
```

---

**Example:** End-of-Line Style

```java
// End-of-Line Style
public class Welcome {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
    }
}
```

---

## 1.10. Programming Errors

---

### Types of Errors

Programming errors can be categorized into three types:

- **Syntax Errors**: Detected by the compiler and result from code construction mistakes like mistyped keywords, missing punctuation, or unmatched braces.

- **Runtime Errors**: Occur during program execution and cause abnormal termination. Typically caused by operations impossible to carry out, such as dividing by zero or incorrect input types.

- **Logic Errors**: Occur when a program doesn't perform as intended due to incorrect logic, such as using the wrong formula.

---

**Example:** Syntax Error

```java
public class Welcome {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java!")
    }
}
```

---

**Example:** Runtime Error

```java
public class Welcome {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        int y = 0;
        int z = x / y; // Division by zero
        System.out.println(z);
    }
}
```

---

**Example:** Logic Error

```java
public class Welcome {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        int y = 3;
        int z = x - y; // Incorrect operation
        System.out.println(z);
    }
}
```

---

### Detection and Fixing

- **Syntax Errors**: Easy to detect as the compiler indicates the error location and cause.

- **Runtime Errors**: Identified when the program crashes or gives unexpected results.

- **Logic Errors**: Challenging to identify as the program runs without errors but produces incorrect results. Requires thorough testing and debugging.
