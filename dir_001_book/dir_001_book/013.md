# Chapter 13: Abstract Classes and Interfaces

---

## 13.1. Introduction

---

### Key Concepts

- **Superclass**: Defines common behavior for related subclasses.
- **Interface**: Defines common behavior for classes, including unrelated classes.

---

### Example

- **Sorting with `java.util.Arrays.sort`**:
  - Can sort arrays of numbers or strings.
  - To sort arrays of geometric objects, interfaces are needed.

---

### Abstract Classes

- Closely related to interfaces.
- Introduced before discussing interfaces.

---

### Importance

- Understanding abstract classes and interfaces is crucial for designing flexible and reusable code.

---

### Discussion Points

- How superclasses and interfaces help in defining common behaviors.
- The role of abstract classes in inheritance hierarchy.

---

### Questions

- Can you apply the same sort method to sort an array of geometric objects?
- Why are interfaces important for defining common behavior?

---

## 13.2. Abstract Classes

---

### Key Concepts

- **Abstract Class**: A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods.
- **Abstract Method**: A method without implementation, meant to be overridden in subclasses.

---

### Characteristics

- Abstract classes are used to define common features for subclasses.
- They can contain both abstract methods and concrete methods.
- Abstract methods are declared using the `abstract` keyword.

---

### Example: GeometricObject

- **GeometricObject**: An abstract class for geometric shapes.
  - Contains abstract methods `getArea()` and `getPerimeter()`.
  - Subclasses like `Circle` and `Rectangle` provide implementations for these methods.

---

### UML Representation

- Abstract class names and methods are italicized.
- Example:
  - `GeometricObject` (abstract class)
    - `getArea()` (abstract method)
    - `getPerimeter()` (abstract method)

---

### Benefits

- Promotes code reuse by defining common behavior in a superclass.
- Ensures that subclasses implement specific methods.

---

### Discussion Points

- Why use abstract classes instead of regular classes?
- How do abstract methods enforce a contract for subclasses?

---

### Questions

- What is an abstract class and how is it different from a regular class?
- Why can't you instantiate an abstract class?
- How do abstract methods benefit the design of a class hierarchy?

---

## 13.3. Case Study: The Abstract Number Class

---

## 13.4. Case Study: Calendar and GregorianCalendar

---

## 13.5. Interfaces

---

### Key Concepts

- **Interface**: A class-like construct for defining common operations for objects.
- **Interface Inheritance**: A class can implement multiple interfaces, defining a contract for behavior.

---

### Characteristics

- Interfaces can contain abstract methods and constants.
- Methods in interfaces are implicitly `public` and `abstract`.
- Fields in interfaces are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`.

---

### Example: Edible Interface

- **Edible Interface**: Specifies that an object is edible.
  - Method: `howToEat()`
- **Implementing Classes**:
  - `Chicken` implements `Edible` and `Animal`
  - `Apple` and `Orange` implement `Edible` and extend `Fruit`

---

### Code Example

```java
public interface Edible {
        String howToEat();
}

class Chicken extends Animal implements Edible {
        @Override
        public String howToEat() {
                return "Chicken: Fry it";
        }

        @Override
        public String sound() {
                return "Chicken: cock-a-doodle-doo";
        }
}

class Apple extends Fruit implements Edible {
        @Override
        public String howToEat() {
                return "Apple: Make apple cider";
        }
}
```

---

### Benefits

- Promotes flexibility by allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces.
- Defines a contract for what a class can do, without dictating how it does it.

---

### Discussion Points

- How interfaces differ from abstract classes.
- The role of interfaces in achieving multiple inheritance in Java.

---

### Questions

- What is an interface and how is it different from an abstract class?
- Why can't you instantiate an interface?
- How do interfaces promote flexibility in code design?

---

## 13.6. The Comparable Interface

---

### Key Concepts

- **Comparable Interface**: Defines a method for comparing objects.
- **compareTo Method**: Used to determine the order of objects.

---

### Characteristics

- The `Comparable` interface is generic and defined as `Comparable<T>`.
- The `compareTo` method returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if the object is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.

---

### Example: Implementing Comparable

- **Integer, String, Date**: Classes that implement `Comparable`.
- **Custom Class**: Implementing `Comparable` in a user-defined class.

---

### Code Example

```java
public class ComparableRectangle extends Rectangle implements Comparable<ComparableRectangle> {
    @Override
    public int compareTo(ComparableRectangle o) {
        if (getArea() > o.getArea())
            return 1;
        else if (getArea() < o.getArea())
            return -1;
        else
            return 0;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Width: " + getWidth() + " Height: " + getHeight() + " Area: " + getArea();
    }
}
```

---

### Benefits

- Enables sorting of objects using `java.util.Arrays.sort`.
- Provides a natural ordering for objects.

---

### Discussion Points

- How the `compareTo` method works.
- The importance of implementing `Comparable` for custom classes.

---

### Questions

- What is the `Comparable` interface and what is its purpose?
- How does the `compareTo` method determine the order of objects?
- Why is it beneficial to implement `Comparable` in custom classes?

---

## 13.7. The Cloneable Interface

---

### Key Concepts

- **Cloneable Interface**: Specifies that an object can be cloned.
- **Marker Interface**: An interface with no methods, used to indicate that a class has a certain property.

---

### Characteristics

- The `Cloneable` interface is a marker interface with no methods.
- A class must implement `Cloneable` to indicate that its instances can be cloned.
- The `clone()` method is defined in the `Object` class and must be overridden in the subclass.

---

### Example: Implementing Cloneable

- **Cloneable Interface**: Indicates that a class can be cloned.
- **Overriding `clone()` Method**: Provides the implementation for cloning an object.

---

### Code Example

```java
public class House implements Cloneable {
    private int id;
    private double area;

    public House(int id, double area) {
        this.id = id;
        this.area = area;
    }

    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone();
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "House [id=" + id + ", area=" + area + "]";
    }
}

public class TestClone {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            House house1 = new House(1, 120.5);
            House house2 = (House) house1.clone();
            System.out.println(house1);
            System.out.println(house2);
        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

---

### Benefits

- Allows creating exact copies of objects.
- Useful for copying complex objects with many fields.

---

### Discussion Points

- The role of the `Cloneable` interface in object cloning.
- How to properly override the `clone()` method.
- The difference between shallow and deep cloning.

---

### Questions

- What is the `Cloneable` interface and what is its purpose?
- How do you implement cloning in a class?
- What are the potential issues with cloning objects?

---

## 13.8. Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes

---

### Key Concepts

- **Abstract Class**: A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain both abstract and concrete methods.
- **Interface**: A class-like construct that defines a contract for behavior, containing only abstract methods (until Java 8, which introduced default and static methods).

---

### Differences

- **Instantiation**:
  - Abstract Class: Cannot be instantiated.
  - Interface: Cannot be instantiated.
- **Methods**:
  - Abstract Class: Can have both abstract and concrete methods.
  - Interface: Can have only abstract methods (until Java 8, which allows default and static methods).
- **Fields**:
  - Abstract Class: Can have instance variables.
  - Interface: Can only have constants (public, static, final).
- **Inheritance**:
  - Abstract Class: A class can extend only one abstract class.
  - Interface: A class can implement multiple interfaces.

---

### Example: Abstract Class vs. Interface

- **Abstract Class Example**:

```java
public abstract class Animal {
        private String name;

        public Animal(String name) {
                this.name = name;
        }

        public String getName() {
                return name;
        }

        public abstract void sound();
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
        public Dog(String name) {
                super(name);
        }

        @Override
        public void sound() {
                System.out.println("Woof");
        }
}
```

- **Interface Example**:

```java
public interface Edible {
        String howToEat();
}

public class Apple implements Edible {
        @Override
        public String howToEat() {
                return "Apple: Make apple cider";
        }
}
```

---

### Benefits

- **Abstract Class**:
  - Provides a common base class with shared code.
  - Useful for closely related classes.
- **Interface**:
  - Promotes flexibility by allowing multiple inheritance.
  - Defines a contract for what a class can do, without dictating how it does it.

---

### Discussion Points

- When to use an abstract class vs. an interface.
- The role of abstract classes and interfaces in designing flexible and reusable code.

---

### Questions

- What are the main differences between an abstract class and an interface?
- When would you choose to use an abstract class over an interface, and vice versa?
- How do interfaces promote multiple inheritance in Java?

---

## 13.10. Class-Design Guidelines

---

### Key Concepts

- **Class Design**: Principles and best practices for designing classes in object-oriented programming.
- **Encapsulation**: Keeping data private and providing public methods for access.
- **Cohesion**: Ensuring a class has a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **Coupling**: Minimizing dependencies between classes.

---

### Guidelines

1. **Encapsulation**:

   - Keep data fields private.
   - Provide public getter and setter methods.
   - Example:

     ```java
     public class Person {
           private String name;
           private int age;

           public String getName() {
                return name;
           }

           public void setName(String name) {
                this.name = name;
           }

           public int getAge() {
                return age;
           }

           public void setAge(int age) {
                this.age = age;
           }
     }
     ```

2. **Cohesion**:

   - Ensure each class has a single responsibility.
   - Example:

     ```java
     public class Address {
           private String street;
           private String city;
           private String zipCode;

           // Methods related to address
     }

     public class Person {
           private String name;
           private Address address;

           // Methods related to person
     }
     ```

3. **Coupling**:

   - Reduce dependencies between classes.
   - Use interfaces to decouple classes.
   - Example:

     ```java
     public interface Payment {
           void pay(double amount);
     }

     public class CreditCardPayment implements Payment {
           @Override
           public void pay(double amount) {
                // Implementation for credit card payment
           }
     }

     public class Order {
           private Payment payment;

           public Order(Payment payment) {
                this.payment = payment;
           }

           public void processOrder(double amount) {
                payment.pay(amount);
           }
     }
     ```

4. **Inheritance**:

   - Use inheritance to promote code reuse.
   - Ensure the "is-a" relationship is appropriate.
   - Example:

     ```java
     public class Animal {
           public void eat() {
                System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
           }
     }

     public class Dog extends Animal {
           @Override
           public void eat() {
                System.out.println("The dog eats dog food.");
           }
     }
     ```

5. **Polymorphism**:

   - Use polymorphism to handle different types through a common interface.
   - Example:

     ```java
     public interface Shape {
           double getArea();
     }

     public class Circle implements Shape {
           private double radius;

           public Circle(double radius) {
                this.radius = radius;
           }

           @Override
           public double getArea() {
                return Math.PI * radius * radius;
           }
     }

     public class Rectangle implements Shape {
           private double width;
           private double height;

           public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
                this.width = width;
                this.height = height;
           }

           @Override
           public double getArea() {
                return width * height;
           }
     }
     ```
