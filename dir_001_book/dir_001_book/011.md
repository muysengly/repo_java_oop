# Chapter 11: Inheritance and Polymorphism

## 11.1. Introduction to Inheritance and Polymorphism

**Key Points:**

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

  - Focuses on objects and operations on objects.
  - Combines data and methods into objects.
  - Inheritance is a key feature for reusing software.

- **Inheritance:**
  - Allows defining new classes from existing classes.
  - Helps avoid redundancy and makes the system easier to comprehend and maintain.
  - Example: Designing classes for geometric objects like circles, rectangles, and triangles.

**Why Use Inheritance?**

- **Code Reusability:** Avoids rewriting common properties and behaviors.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to manage and update code.
- **Extensibility:** New classes can be added with minimal changes to existing code.

**Example Scenario:**

- **Geometric Objects:**
  - Common properties: color, filled status, creation date.
  - Specialized classes: Circle, Rectangle, Triangle.
  - General class: GeometricObject to model all geometric objects.

**Conclusion:**

- Inheritance is a powerful tool in OOP that promotes code reuse, maintainability, and extensibility by allowing new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes.

## 11.2. Superclasses and Subclasses

**Key Points:**

- **Superclass (Parent Class):**

  - A general class that defines common properties and behaviors.
  - Example: `GeometricObject` class with properties like `color`, `filled`, and methods like `getColor()`, `setColor()`.

- **Subclass (Child Class):**
  - A specialized class that extends a superclass.
  - Inherits properties and methods from the superclass.
  - Can add new properties and methods.
  - Example: `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes extending `GeometricObject`.

**Inheritance Relationship:**

- **"Is-a" Relationship:**
  - A subclass is a specialized version of the superclass.
  - Example: A `Circle` is a `GeometricObject`.

**Example:**

- **GeometricObject Class:**

  - Properties: `color`, `filled`, `dateCreated`.
  - Methods: `getColor()`, `setColor()`, `isFilled()`, `setFilled()`, `getDateCreated()`, `toString()`.

- **Circle Class:**

  - Inherits from `GeometricObject`.
  - Adds property: `radius`.
  - Adds methods: `getRadius()`, `setRadius()`, `getArea()`, `getPerimeter()`, `getDiameter()`.

- **Rectangle Class:**
  - Inherits from `GeometricObject`.
  - Adds properties: `width`, `height`.
  - Adds methods: `getWidth()`, `setWidth()`, `getHeight()`, `setHeight()`, `getArea()`, `getPerimeter()`.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Subclass and Superclass:**

  - Subclass inherits accessible data fields and methods from the superclass.
  - Subclass can add new data fields and methods.

- **Type and Subtype:**
  - A subclass defines a subtype.
  - A superclass defines a supertype.

**Conclusion:**

- Inheritance allows for the creation of specialized classes (subclasses) from a general class (superclass), promoting code reuse and extensibility. The "is-a" relationship ensures that subclasses are specialized versions of their superclasses.

## 11.3. Using the `super` Keyword

**Key Points:**

- **Purpose of `super`:**
  - Refers to the superclass.
  - Used to invoke superclass constructors and methods.

**1. Calling Superclass Constructors:**

- **Syntax:**
  - `super()`: Calls the no-arg constructor of the superclass.
  - `super(arguments)`: Calls the superclass constructor that matches the arguments.
- **Rules:**
  - Must be the first statement in the subclass constructor.
  - Constructors are not inherited; they must be explicitly called using `super`.

**Example:**

```java
public Circle(double radius, String color, boolean filled) {
    super(color, filled); // Calls GeometricObject's constructor
    this.radius = radius;
}
```

**2. Constructor Chaining:**

- **Process:**
  - When constructing an instance of a subclass, the superclass constructor is invoked first.
  - This continues up the inheritance chain until the `Object` class constructor is called.
- **Example:**
  - `Faculty` → `Employee` → `Person` → `Object`.

**3. Calling Superclass Methods:**

- **Syntax:**
  - `super.method(arguments)`: Calls a method from the superclass.
- **Example:**

```java
public void printCircle() {
    System.out.println("The circle is created " + super.getDateCreated() + " and the radius is " + radius);
}
```

**Key Concepts:**

- **Constructor Chaining:**
  - Ensures that all superclass constructors are called in the correct order.
- **Method Overriding:**
  - Allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method defined in the superclass.
  - Use `super` to call the superclass method if needed.

**Conclusion:**

- The `super` keyword is essential for accessing superclass constructors and methods, ensuring proper initialization and functionality in subclass instances. It plays a crucial role in constructor chaining and method overriding, enabling effective inheritance and polymorphism.

## 11.4. Overriding Methods

**Key Points:**

- **Method Overriding:**
  - A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
  - The method in the subclass must have the same signature (name and parameters) and return type as the method in the superclass.

**Rules for Overriding:**

1. **Signature and Return Type:**

   - Must match the overridden method in the superclass.
   - Return type can be a subtype (covariant return type).

2. **Accessibility:**

   - The overriding method must be at least as accessible as the overridden method.
   - Cannot override a `private` method (it is not accessible).

3. **Static Methods:**
   - Static methods cannot be overridden; they can be hidden if redefined in the subclass.

**Example:**

```java
public class Circle extends GeometricObject {
    // Other methods omitted

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return super.toString() + "\nradius is " + radius;
    }
}
```

**Using `@Override` Annotation:**

- **Purpose:**
  - Indicates that a method is intended to override a method in the superclass.
  - Helps catch errors at compile time if the method does not actually override anything.

**Example with `@Override`:**

```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return super.toString() + "\nradius is " + radius;
}
```

**Key Concepts:**

- **Overriding vs. Overloading:**

  - Overriding: Same method signature in subclass and superclass.
  - Overloading: Same method name but different parameter lists.

- **Dynamic Binding:**
  - The actual method implementation to be executed is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type.

**Conclusion:**

- Method overriding allows subclasses to provide specific implementations of methods defined in their superclasses, enabling polymorphism and dynamic binding. The `@Override` annotation helps ensure that the method is correctly overriding a superclass method, reducing the risk of errors.

## 11.5. Overriding vs. Overloading

**Key Points:**

- **Overriding:**

  - Provides a new implementation for a method in a subclass.
  - The method in the subclass must have the same signature (name and parameters) and return type as the method in the superclass.
  - Example:

    ```java
    class B {
        public void p(double i) {
            System.out.println(i * 2);
        }
    }

    class A extends B {
        @Override
        public void p(double i) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
    ```

- **Overloading:**

  - Defines multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
  - Can occur within the same class or between a class and its subclass.
  - Example:

    ```java
    class B {
        public void p(double i) {
            System.out.println(i * 2);
        }
    }

    class A extends B {
        public void p(int i) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
    ```

**Differences:**

- **Location:**

  - Overridden methods are in different classes related by inheritance.
  - Overloaded methods can be in the same class or different classes related by inheritance.

- **Signature:**

  - Overridden methods have the same signature.
  - Overloaded methods have the same name but different parameter lists.

- **Binding:**
  - Overridden methods are resolved at runtime (dynamic binding).
  - Overloaded methods are resolved at compile time (static binding).

**Example:**

```java
public class TestOverriding {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new A();
        a.p(10);       // Calls A's p(double i)
        a.p(10.0);     // Calls A's p(double i)
    }
}

public class TestOverloading {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new A();
        a.p(10);       // Calls A's p(int i)
        a.p(10.0);     // Calls B's p(double i)
    }
}
```

**Using `@Override` Annotation:**

- **Purpose:**
  - Ensures that the method is intended to override a method in the superclass.
  - Helps catch errors at compile time if the method does not actually override anything.

**Example with `@Override`:**

```java
public class Circle extends GeometricObject {
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return super.toString() + "\nradius is " + radius;
    }
}
```

**Conclusion:**

- **Overriding** allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method defined in its superclass, enabling polymorphism.
- **Overloading** allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, providing flexibility in method calls.
- Understanding the differences between overriding and overloading is crucial for effective method design and implementation in Java.

## 11.6. - The Object Class and Its toString() Method\*\*

- **Title:** The Object Class and Its toString() Method
- **Key Points:**
  - Every class in Java is implicitly a subclass of `java.lang.Object`.
  - If no inheritance is specified, the superclass is `Object` by default.
  - The `toString()` method is defined in the `Object` class and can be overridden in custom classes.

---

### Slide 2: **The Object Class**

- **Key Points:**
  - All classes in Java inherit from `Object`.
  - Examples: `String`, `StringBuilder`, `Loan`, and `GeometricObject` are all subclasses of `Object`.
  - The `Object` class provides default implementations for methods like `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()`.

---

### Slide 3: **The toString() Method**

- **Key Points:**
  - **Signature:** `public String toString()`
  - **Default Behavior:** Returns a string representation of the object, typically in the format: `ClassName@hashCode`.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    Loan loan = new Loan();
    System.out.println(loan.toString()); // Output: Loan@1503765
    ```
  - **Override:** You can override `toString()` to provide a more meaningful string representation.

---

### Slide 4: **Overriding toString()**

- **Key Points:**
  - Override `toString()` to return a descriptive string representation of the object.
  - **Example in `GeometricObject` class:**
    ```java
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "created on " + dateCreated + "\ncolor: " + color + " and filled: " + filled;
    }
    ```
  - **Usage:**
    ```java
    System.out.println(object); // Implicitly calls object.toString()
    ```

---

### Slide 5: **Benefits of Overriding toString()**

- **Key Points:**
  - Provides a clear and concise description of the object.
  - Useful for debugging and logging.
  - Simplifies printing object details without needing to call multiple getter methods.

---

### Slide 6: **Summary**

- **Key Points:**
  - Every class in Java inherits from `Object`.
  - The `toString()` method is used to return a string representation of an object.
  - Override `toString()` to provide meaningful descriptions of your objects.
  - Example: Override `toString()` in custom classes like `GeometricObject` to display object details.

---

### Slide 7: **Questions?**

- **Key Points:**
  - Any questions on the `Object` class or the `toString()` method?
  - How would you override `toString()` in your own classes?

## 11.7. - Polymorphism\*\*

- **Title:** Polymorphism
- **Key Points:**
  - Polymorphism is one of the three pillars of object-oriented programming (along with encapsulation and inheritance).
  - It allows a variable of a supertype to refer to a subtype object.
  - Enables flexibility and extensibility in code.

---

### Slide 2: **What is Polymorphism?**

- **Key Points:**
  - **Definition:** Polymorphism means "many forms." In Java, it allows a superclass reference to point to a subclass object.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    GeometricObject obj = new Circle(); // Polymorphic assignment
    ```
  - A `Circle` is a `GeometricObject`, so this assignment is valid.

---

### Slide 3: **Polymorphism in Action**

- **Key Points:**
  - **Example Code:**
    ```java
    public static void displayObject(GeometricObject obj) {
        System.out.println("Created on " + obj.getDateCreated());
    }
    ```
  - **Usage:**
    ```java
    displayObject(new Circle());    // Works
    displayObject(new Rectangle()); // Also works
    ```
  - The method `displayObject` can accept any subclass of `GeometricObject`.

---

### Slide 4: **Benefits of Polymorphism**

- **Key Points:**
  - **Flexibility:** A single method can handle objects of different subclasses.
  - **Extensibility:** New subclasses can be added without modifying existing code.
  - **Code Reusability:** Reduces redundancy by allowing shared behavior in superclasses.

---

### Slide 5: **Dynamic Binding**

- **Key Points:**
  - **Dynamic Binding:** The JVM decides which method implementation to call at runtime based on the actual object type.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    GeometricObject obj = new Circle();
    System.out.println(obj.toString()); // Calls Circle's toString()
    ```
  - The method `toString()` is dynamically bound to the actual object type (`Circle`).

---

### Slide 6: **Polymorphism and Inheritance**

- **Key Points:**
  - Polymorphism relies on inheritance.
  - A subclass can be treated as an instance of its superclass.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    GeometricObject obj = new Circle();
    obj.getArea(); // Calls Circle's getArea() if overridden
    ```
  - The actual method called depends on the object's runtime type.

---

### Slide 7: **Summary**

- **Key Points:**
  - Polymorphism allows a superclass reference to point to a subclass object.
  - Enables flexible and extensible code.
  - Dynamic binding ensures the correct method is called at runtime.
  - Example: A `GeometricObject` reference can point to a `Circle` or `Rectangle`.

---

### Slide 8: **Questions?**

- **Key Points:**
  - Any questions on polymorphism or dynamic binding?
  - How would you use polymorphism in your own programs?

## 11.8. Dynamic Binding\*\*

Dynamic binding refers to the process where the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) determines at runtime which method to invoke when a method is called on an object. This decision is based on the actual type of the object rather than its declared type.

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Declared Type vs. Actual Type:**

   - A variable has a declared type (the type specified when it is defined).
   - The actual type of an object is the class from which the object was instantiated.

2. **Method Resolution at Runtime:**

   - When a method is called on an object, the JVM searches for the implementation of that method starting from the object's actual type and moving up the inheritance hierarchy until it finds the method.
   - This is different from compile-time method matching, which only checks if the method exists based on the declared type.

3. **Example Demonstration:**

   ```java
   Object o = new GeometricObject();
   System.out.println(o.toString());
   ```

   - Although `o` is declared as `Object`, it refers to an instance of `GeometricObject`.
   - The overridden `toString()` method in `GeometricObject` is invoked instead of the `Object` class’s `toString()` method due to dynamic binding.

4. **Listing 11.6 (DynamicBindingDemo.java):**

   - A method `m(Object x)` is used to call `toString()` on different objects (`GraduateStudent`, `Student`, `Person`, `Object`).
   - The method executed depends on the actual type of the object passed to `m()`.

5. **Method Matching vs. Method Binding:**
   - **Method Matching (Compile-time):** The compiler checks if the method signature exists for the declared type.
   - **Method Binding (Runtime):** The JVM determines which version of the method to execute based on the object's actual type.

### **Conclusion:**

Dynamic binding enables polymorphism by allowing method calls to be resolved at runtime based on an object's actual type, leading to more flexible and maintainable code.

## 11.9. Casting Objects and the `instanceof` Operator\*\*

### **1. Casting Objects**

- **Implicit Casting (Upcasting):**

  - Assigning a subclass object to a superclass variable happens automatically.
  - Example:
    ```java
    Object obj = new Student(); // Upcasting (implicit)
    ```
  - Since every `Student` is an `Object`, this is always safe.

- **Explicit Casting (Downcasting):**
  - Assigning a superclass object to a subclass variable requires explicit casting.
  - Example:
    ```java
    Student student = (Student) obj; // Downcasting (explicit)
    ```
  - Must ensure that `obj` is actually an instance of `Student` before casting.
  - **Incorrect casting leads to `ClassCastException`.**

### **2. The `instanceof` Operator**

- Used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class before casting.
- Prevents `ClassCastException` errors.
- Example:
  ```java
  if (obj instanceof Student) {
      Student student = (Student) obj;
      System.out.println("Valid cast!");
  }
  ```
- Returns `true` if `obj` is an instance of `Student` or its subclass.

### **3. Key Points**

✅ **Upcasting is always safe** (e.g., subclass → superclass).  
✅ **Downcasting requires explicit casting** and must be verified with `instanceof`.  
✅ **Incorrect downcasting causes `ClassCastException` at runtime**.  
✅ **Useful for polymorphic behavior and generic programming**.

### **4. Example: CastingDemo.java**

- Demonstrates polymorphism and the `instanceof` check before casting.
- Ensures safe type conversion and method access.

## 11.10. The Object’s `equals` Method\*\*

### **1. The `equals` Method in Java**

- Defined in the `Object` class:
  ```java
  public boolean equals(Object obj) {
      return this == obj; // Default behavior (checks memory address)
  }
  ```
- By default, it checks **reference equality** (whether two variables point to the same object).

### **2. Overriding the `equals` Method**

- To compare object **contents**, override `equals()`.
- Example (for comparing `Circle` objects by radius):
  ```java
  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
      if (o instanceof Circle) {
          return this.radius == ((Circle) o).radius;
      }
      return false;
  }
  ```
- Ensures objects with the same data are treated as **equal**.

### **3. `==` vs. `.equals()`**

| Comparison Type  | `==` (Reference Equality) | `.equals()` (Content Equality)          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Compares         | Memory addresses          | Object contents                         |
| Default behavior | Same object instances     | Must override for meaningful comparison |

### **4. Common Mistake: Incorrect Method Signature**

🚨 **Wrong:**

```java
public boolean equals(Circle c) { ... } // Incorrect!
```

✅ **Correct:**

```java
public boolean equals(Object o) { ... }
```

- Must use `Object` as the parameter type to properly override `equals()`.

### **5. Key Takeaways**

✅ **Override `equals()` to compare object contents.**  
✅ **Use `instanceof` before casting to avoid errors.**  
✅ **The default `equals()` checks references, not values.**  
✅ **Always use `equals()` instead of `==` for object comparisons.**

## 11.11. The `ArrayList` Class\*\*

### **1. What is an `ArrayList`?**

- A **resizable array-like data structure** in Java.
- Part of `java.util` package.
- Stores objects dynamically (unlike fixed-size arrays).
- Example declaration:
  ```java
  ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
  ```

### **2. Key Features of `ArrayList`**

✅ **Dynamic Sizing** – Automatically grows/shrinks as needed.  
✅ **Index-Based Access** – Like arrays, elements can be accessed via index.  
✅ **Supports Generic Types** – Can store objects of any class.  
✅ **Provides Built-in Methods** – For easy manipulation of elements.

### **3. Commonly Used `ArrayList` Methods**

| Method                | Description                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `add(E e)`            | Adds an element to the list.                          |
| `add(int index, E e)` | Inserts an element at a specific index.               |
| `remove(Object o)`    | Removes the first occurrence of the specified object. |
| `remove(int index)`   | Removes the element at a specified index.             |
| `get(int index)`      | Retrieves the element at a given index.               |
| `set(int index, E e)` | Updates the element at a given index.                 |
| `size()`              | Returns the number of elements in the list.           |
| `contains(Object o)`  | Checks if the list contains an object.                |
| `clear()`             | Removes all elements from the list.                   |

### **4. Example Usage**

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class TestArrayList {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> cities = new ArrayList<>();
        cities.add("New York");
        cities.add("London");
        cities.add(1, "Paris");  // Inserts "Paris" at index 1

        cities.remove("London"); // Removes "London"

        System.out.println("Cities: " + cities);
        System.out.println("First City: " + cities.get(0));
    }
}
```

### **5. Differences Between Arrays & `ArrayList`**

| Feature          | Array                | `ArrayList`                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Size**         | Fixed                | Dynamic                     |
| **Performance**  | Faster (no resizing) | Slower (due to resizing)    |
| **Memory Usage** | Efficient            | Uses more memory            |
| **Flexibility**  | Cannot grow/shrink   | Can grow/shrink dynamically |

### **6. Key Takeaways**

✅ **`ArrayList` is more flexible than arrays.**  
✅ **Use generic types to ensure type safety (`ArrayList<Type>`).**  
✅ **Use `ArrayList` methods for easy list operations.**  
✅ **Useful for dynamic collections where size changes frequently.**

## 11.12. Useful Methods for Lists\*\*

### **1. Introduction to List Methods**

- Java provides various utility methods for working with lists.
- Methods are available in **`java.util.Collections`** and the `List` interface.
- Common operations: Sorting, shuffling, searching, and finding min/max elements.

### **2. Commonly Used Methods in `Collections` Class**

| Method                                              | Description                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sort(List<T> list)`                                | Sorts the list in **ascending order** (natural ordering). |
| `shuffle(List<?> list)`                             | Randomly shuffles elements in the list.                   |
| `reverse(List<?> list)`                             | Reverses the order of elements.                           |
| `max(Collection<? extends T> coll)`                 | Returns the **largest** element.                          |
| `min(Collection<? extends T> coll)`                 | Returns the **smallest** element.                         |
| `binarySearch(List<? extends T> list, T key)`       | Searches for an element (must be sorted first).           |
| `fill(List<? super T> list, T obj)`                 | Replaces all elements with a specified object.            |
| `copy(List<? super T> dest, List<? extends T> src)` | Copies elements from one list to another.                 |

### **3. Example Usage**

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ListMethodsDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(5, 2, 9, 1, 7));

        Collections.sort(numbers);  // Sort list
        System.out.println("Sorted: " + numbers);

        Collections.shuffle(numbers); // Shuffle list
        System.out.println("Shuffled: " + numbers);

        System.out.println("Max: " + Collections.max(numbers));
        System.out.println("Min: " + Collections.min(numbers));

        int index = Collections.binarySearch(numbers, 7); // List must be sorted first
        System.out.println("Index of 7: " + index);
    }
}
```

### **4. Key Takeaways**

✅ `Collections.sort()` sorts elements in ascending order.  
✅ `Collections.shuffle()` randomizes the list order.  
✅ `Collections.max()` & `Collections.min()` find extreme values.  
✅ `Collections.binarySearch()` finds an element in a **sorted** list.  
✅ `Collections.reverse()` flips the order of elements.

## 11.13. Case Study – A Custom Stack Class\*\*

## 11.14. The `protected` Data and Methods\*\*

### **1. What is the `protected` Access Modifier?**

- The `protected` keyword allows **subclasses** and **classes in the same package** to access data and methods.
- More accessible than `private`, but more restricted than `public`.

### **2. Access Levels in Java**

| Modifier                | Same Class | Same Package | Subclass (Different Package) | Outside Class |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| `private`               | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No        | ❌ No                        | ❌ No         |
| **`protected`**         | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes                       | ❌ No         |
| `public`                | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes                       | ✅ Yes        |
| No Modifier _(default)_ | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No                        | ❌ No         |

### **3. Example: Using `protected` in a Superclass**

```java
class Animal {
    protected String name;

    protected void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(name + " makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public void bark() {
        name = "Dog";  // Accessible due to `protected`
        makeSound();   // Accessible due to `protected`
        System.out.println(name + " barks!");
    }
}

public class TestProtected {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.bark();
    }
}
```

✅ `name` and `makeSound()` are **accessible** in `Dog` because of `protected`.  
❌ **Not accessible outside the package unless through inheritance**.

### **4. Key Takeaways**

✅ `protected` allows subclass access, even if in a different package.  
✅ More restrictive than `public`, but more flexible than `private`.  
✅ Used for **inheritance** when subclass needs access to superclass members.

## 11.15. Preventing Extending and Overriding\*\*

### **1. Why Prevent Inheritance and Method Overriding?**

- Ensures **security and consistency** by preventing unintended modifications.
- Helps create **immutable** classes and methods.

### **2. Using `final` to Prevent Inheritance**

- Declaring a class as `final` **prevents it from being extended**.
- Example:

  ```java
  final class MathUtils {
      public static double square(double x) {
          return x * x;
      }
  }

  // ❌ Error: Cannot extend a final class
  class AdvancedMath extends MathUtils { }
  ```

  ✅ `MathUtils` is **sealed** from being inherited.

### **3. Using `final` to Prevent Method Overriding**

- Declaring a method as `final` prevents **subclasses from modifying it**.
- Example:

  ```java
  class Animal {
      public final void makeSound() {
          System.out.println("Animal makes a sound.");
      }
  }

  class Dog extends Animal {
      // ❌ Error: Cannot override a final method
      public void makeSound() {
          System.out.println("Dog barks!");
      }
  }
  ```

  ✅ Ensures `makeSound()` **cannot be changed** in subclasses.

### **4. Key Takeaways**

✅ `final class` → **Prevents inheritance** (no subclasses).  
✅ `final method` → **Prevents overriding** in subclasses.  
✅ `final` ensures **security, immutability, and controlled behavior**.
