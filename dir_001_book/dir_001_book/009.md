# Chapter 9: <br> Objects and Classes <br> Part - II

---

## 9.6. Using Classes from the Java Library

---

### Java API (Application Programming Interface)

- A collection of prebuilt classes provided by Java.
- Simplifies programming tasks by offering reusable components.

---

### Commonly Used Java Library Classes

1. **`Date` Class**:
   - Represents a specific date and time.
   - Provides methods to manipulate and format dates.
2. **`Random` Class**:
   - Generates random numbers.
   - Useful for simulations, games, and testing.
3. **`Point2D` Class**:
   - Represents a point in a 2D plane.
   - Useful for geometric calculations like distance and midpoint.

---

### Benefits of Using Java Library Classes

- Saves development time by reusing tested and optimized code.
- Enhances code readability and maintainability.
- Provides solutions for common programming challenges.

---

### Key Takeaway

- Leveraging Java's built-in classes can significantly improve productivity and efficiency in software development.

---

### `Date` Class `java.util.Date`

- Represents a specific date and time.
- The no-arg constructor creates a `Date` object for the current date and time.

Example:

```java
java.util.Date date = new java.util.Date();
System.out.println(date.toString());
```

- `getTime()` returns the number of milliseconds since **January 1, 1970 (Epoch time)**.
- A `Date` object can also be created with a specific timestamp:
  ```java
  Date date = new Date(1000000000000L);
  ```

---

### `Random` Class `java.util.Random`

- Used to generate random numbers.

Example:

```java
java.util.Random rand = new java.util.Random();
int randomNumber = rand.nextInt(100); // Generates a random number between 0 and 99
```

- A seed can be provided to generate the same sequence of random numbers.

---

### `Point2D` Class `javafx.geometry.Point2D`

- Represents a point in a 2D plane with `x` and `y` coordinates.
- Useful for geometric calculations like distance and midpoint.

Example:

```java
import javafx.geometry.Point2D;
Point2D p1 = new Point2D(3, 4);
Point2D p2 = new Point2D(6, 8);
double distance = p1.distance(p2);
```

- The `toString()` method provides a readable format for points.

---

### Key Takeaways:

- Java provides built-in classes for handling common programming tasks like date/time management, random number generation, and geometric calculations.
- Using these predefined classes simplifies coding and improves efficiency.
- `Date` and `Random` are in the `java.util` package, while `Point2D` is in `javafx.geometry`.
- Java also offers `SecureRandom` (from `java.security`) for cryptographic-level randomness.

Understanding and utilizing Java's built-in classes can significantly enhance program functionality and reduce development time.

---

## 9.7. Static Variables, Constants, and Methods

---

- In Java, the **`static`** keyword is used to define class-level variables and methods that are shared across all instances of a class.

---

### Static Variables (Class Variables)

- Shared among all instances of a class.
- Declared using the `static` keyword.
- Stored in a common memory location, rather than being unique to each object.

Example:

```java
class Circle {
    double radius;
    static int numberOfObjects = 0; // Shared among all instances

    Circle(double newRadius) {
        radius = newRadius;
        numberOfObjects++; // Increment when a new object is created
    }
}
```

---

### Static Methods

- Can be called without creating an object of the class.
- Cannot access instance variables or instance methods directly.
- Typically used for utility functions or to operate on static variables.

Example:

```java
public static int getNumberOfObjects() {
    return numberOfObjects;
}
```

---

### Static vs. Instance Members

- **Instance variables and methods** belong to individual objects.
- **Static variables and methods** belong to the class itself.
- **A static method cannot access non-static (instance) variables/methods directly.**

---

### Constants in Java

- Declared as `static final` to make them shared and unchangeable.

Example:

```java
public class MathConstants {
    public static final double PI = 3.141592653589793;
}
```

---

### Accessing Static Members

- Recommended to access static members using the class name rather than an object reference for clarity.

Example:

```java
System.out.println(Circle.numberOfObjects); // Correct
```

---

### Common Mistakes

- Attempting to access an **instance variable or method** from a **static method** (causes a compilation error).
- Forgetting to declare a shared variable as `static`, causing it to be treated as an instance variable.

---

### Key Takeaways:

- **Static members belong to the class, not instances.**
- **Use `static` when a variable or method should be shared among all objects.**
- **Static methods cannot directly access instance variables/methods.**
- **Use `static final` for constants to prevent modification.**

This section helps in understanding when to use static members and how they differ from instance members.

---

## 9.8. Visibility Modifiers

---

**Visibility modifiers** in Java control access to classes, variables, and methods, ensuring data encapsulation and security.

---

### 1. Visibility Modifiers **`public`**

- Accessible from **anywhere** in the program.
- Used for classes, methods, and variables that should be globally available.

Example:

```java
public class Circle {
    public double radius;  // Can be accessed from any class
}
```

---

### 2. Visibility Modifiers**`private`**

- Accessible **only within the same class**.
- Prevents direct modification of data fields from outside the class (encapsulation).

Example:

```java
class Circle {
    private double radius;  // Only accessible inside the Circle class
}
```

---

- To allow controlled access, **getter and setter methods** are used:
  ```java
  public double getRadius() {
      return radius;
  }
  public void setRadius(double newRadius) {
      radius = newRadius;
  }
  ```

---

### Default (Package-Private, No Modifier

- If no modifier is specified, the member is accessible **only within the same package**.
- Useful for restricting access to related classes within a package.

Example:

```java
class Circle {  // Can be accessed only within the same package
    double radius;
}
```

---

### `protected` Introduced in Chapter 1

- Accessible within the same package **and** by subclasses.
- Used for inheritance scenarios.

---

### Key Takeaways:

- **Use `private` for data fields** to enforce encapsulation.
- **Use `public` for methods that need to be accessed globally.**
- **Use package-private (default) for package-level access.**
- **The `protected` modifier is mainly used in inheritance (covered later).**

By controlling access with visibility modifiers, Java promotes **data protection, modularity, and maintainability** in object-oriented programs.

---

## 9.9. Data Field Encapsulation

---

1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming that involves restricting direct access to an object's data fields. Instead, access is provided through public methods, known as getters and setters.

2. **Private Data Fields**: To prevent direct modification of data fields, they should be declared as `private`. This ensures that the data can only be accessed or modified through the methods provided by the class.

---

3. **Getter and Setter Methods**:

   - **Getter (Accessor)**: A method that returns the value of a private data field. The naming convention is `getPropertyName()` or `isPropertyName()` for boolean fields.
   - **Setter (Mutator)**: A method that sets or updates the value of a private data field. The naming convention is `setPropertyName(dataType propertyValue)`.

---

4. **Benefits of Encapsulation**:

   - **Data Protection**: Prevents unauthorized or unintended modification of data.
   - **Maintainability**: Makes the class easier to maintain and modify. For example, if you need to change how a data field is stored or validated, you only need to update the getter and setter methods, not the entire codebase.
   - **Control**: Allows you to add validation or other logic when data is accessed or modified.

---

5. **Example**:
   - In the `Circle` class, the `radius` and `numberOfObjects` fields are declared as `private`. To access or modify these fields, the class provides `getRadius()`, `setRadius()`, and `getNumberOfObjects()` methods.
   - The `setRadius()` method includes validation to ensure that the radius is non-negative.

---

**Example**

---

```java
public class Circle {
    private double radius = 1; // Private data field
    private static int numberOfObjects = 0; // Private static data field

    // Constructor
    public Circle() {
        numberOfObjects++;
    }

    // Getter for radius
    public double getRadius() {
        return radius;
    }

    // Setter for radius with validation
    public void setRadius(double newRadius) {
        radius = (newRadius >= 0) ? newRadius : 0;
    }

    // Getter for numberOfObjects
    public static int getNumberOfObjects() {
        return numberOfObjects;
    }

    // Method to calculate area
    public double getArea() {
        return radius * radius * Math.PI;
    }
}
```

---

**Example:**

```java
public class TestCircleWithPrivateDataFields {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Circle myCircle = new Circle(5.0);
        System.out.println("The area of the circle of radius " + myCircle.getRadius() + " is " + myCircle.getArea());

        // Increase radius by 10%
        myCircle.setRadius(myCircle.getRadius() * 1.1);
        System.out.println("The area of the circle of radius " + myCircle.getRadius() + " is " + myCircle.getArea());

        System.out.println("The number of objects created is " + Circle.getNumberOfObjects());
    }
}
```

---

### Key Points:

- **Private Data Fields**: Declare data fields as `private` to restrict direct access.
- **Public Methods**: Provide public getter and setter methods to control access to the data fields.
- **Validation**: Use setters to enforce rules or validation when modifying data fields.
- **Maintainability**: Encapsulation makes classes easier to maintain and less prone to bugs.

By following these principles, you can create robust and maintainable classes that protect their internal state while providing controlled access to it.

---

## 9.10. Passing Objects to Methods

---

### Key Concepts:

### Passing Objects to Methods

- When you pass an object to a method in Java, you are actually passing a reference to that object. This means that the method can modify the object's state, and these changes will be reflected outside the method.

---

### Pass-by-Value vs. Pass-by-Reference

- **Primitive Types**: When you pass a primitive type (e.g., `int`, `double`) to a method, the actual value is passed. Changes to the parameter inside the method do not affect the original variable.
- **Reference Types**: When you pass an object (a reference type) to a method, the reference to the object is passed. This means that changes to the object's state inside the method will affect the original object.

**Example**:

- In the example provided, a `Circle` object is passed to the `printAreas` method. Inside the method, the radius of the `Circle` object is modified, and this change is reflected in the original object outside the method.

---

### Call Stack and Heap

- **Call Stack**: Stores method calls and local variables.
- **Heap**: Stores objects and their data. When an object is passed to a method, the reference to the object in the heap is passed.

---

```java
public class TestPassObject {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Circle myCircle = new Circle(1); // Create a Circle object with radius 1
        int n = 5;
        printAreas(myCircle, n); // Pass the Circle object and an integer to the method

        // Print the final radius and n
        System.out.println("\nRadius is " + myCircle.getRadius());
        System.out.println("n is " + n);
    }

    // Method to print areas for increasing radii
    public static void printAreas(Circle c, int times) {
        System.out.println("Radius \t\tArea");
        while (times >= 1) {
            System.out.println(c.getRadius() + "\t\t" + c.getArea());
            c.setRadius(c.getRadius() + 1); // Modify the radius
            times--;
        }
    }
}
```

---

**Output:**

```raw
Radius 		Area
1.0		3.141592653589793
2.0		12.566370614359172
3.0		28.274333882308138
4.0		50.26548245743669
5.0		78.53981633974483

Radius is 6.0
n is 5
```

---

### Key Points:

- **Pass-by-Value for References**: When you pass an object to a method, the reference to the object is passed by value. This means that the method can modify the object's state, but it cannot change the reference itself (i.e., it cannot make the reference point to a different object).
- **Effect on Original Object**: Changes to the object's state inside the method are reflected in the original object outside the method.
- **Primitive vs. Reference Types**: Primitive types are passed by value, and changes inside the method do not affect the original variable. Reference types are also passed by value, but the value is a reference to the object, so changes to the object's state are reflected outside the method.

---

**Illustration of Pass-by-Value for References:**

- When `myCircle` is passed to `printAreas`, the reference to the `Circle` object is passed. Inside `printAreas`, `c` refers to the same object as `myCircle`. Therefore, modifying `c` (e.g., changing the radius) modifies the same object that `myCircle` refers to.

By understanding how objects are passed to methods, you can write methods that effectively manipulate objects and their states, while being aware of the implications of these manipulations on the original objects.

---

## 9.11. Immutable Objects and Classes

---

### Immutable Objects

An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. Once an immutable object is constructed, its data fields cannot be changed.

---

### Immutable Classes

A class is considered immutable if all of its instances are immutable. To create an immutable class, you must ensure that:

- All data fields are declared `private`.
- There are no public setter methods (mutators) that can modify the data fields.
- No methods in the class allow the modification of the internal state of the object.
- If the class has mutable fields (e.g., objects or arrays), ensure that no references to these fields are exposed. Return copies of mutable fields instead of the actual references.

---

### Benefits of Immutable Objects

- **Thread Safety**: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe because their state cannot change after construction.
- **Simplicity**: Immutable objects are easier to reason about since their state is constant.
- **Security**: Immutable objects are safer to use in contexts where the object's state should not be altered, such as in caching or as keys in hash maps.

**Example**:

- The `String` class in Java is an example of an immutable class. Once a `String` object is created, its content cannot be changed.
- If you remove the setter method (`setRadius`) from the `Circle` class, the class becomes immutable because the `radius` field cannot be modified after the object is created.

---

**Example**

```java
public class Circle {
    private double radius; // Private data field

    // Constructor
    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    // Getter for radius (no setter provided)
    public double getRadius() {
        return radius;
    }

    // Method to calculate area
    public double getArea() {
        return radius * radius * Math.PI;
    }
}
```

---

### Key Points:

- **Private Data Fields**: All data fields must be declared `private` to prevent direct access.
- **No Setters**: Do not provide public setter methods that can modify the data fields.
- **Mutable Fields**: If the class contains mutable fields (e.g., arrays or other objects), ensure that no references to these fields are exposed. Return copies of mutable fields instead of the actual references.
- **Final Fields**: While not strictly necessary, declaring data fields as `final` can reinforce immutability by ensuring that the fields cannot be reassigned after construction.

---

**Example**

```java
public class Student {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private java.util.Date dateCreated;
    public Student(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.dateCreated = new java.util.Date();
    }
    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public java.util.Date getDateCreated() {
        return dateCreated; // This exposes a reference to a mutable object
    }
}
```

---

In the above example, the `getDateCreated()` method returns a reference to the `dateCreated` field, which is mutable. This allows the caller to modify the `Date` object, breaking the immutability of the `Student` class.

---

**Solution: Return a Copy of the Mutable Field:**

```java
public java.util.Date getDateCreated() {
    return new java.util.Date(dateCreated.getTime()); // Return a copy of the Date object
}
```

---

### Key Points for Immutable Classes:

- **No Modification**: Ensure that no method allows modification of the object's state.
- **Defensive Copies**: When returning mutable fields, return a copy of the field instead of the actual reference.
- **Final Fields**: Use `final` to prevent reassignment of fields after construction.

By following these principles, you can create immutable classes that provide the benefits of thread safety, simplicity, and security. Immutable objects are particularly useful in concurrent programming and in scenarios where the object's state should remain constant throughout its lifetime.

---

## 9.12. The Scope of Variables

---

### Scope of Variables

The scope of a variable defines where in the program the variable can be accessed. In Java, the scope of a variable depends on where it is declared.

---

### Types of Variables

- **Instance Variables**: Declared inside a class but outside any method. They are accessible from all methods, constructors, and blocks in the class. Their scope is the entire class.
- **Static Variables**: Similar to instance variables but declared with the `static` keyword. They are shared among all instances of the class and have the same scope as instance variables.
- **Local Variables**: Declared inside a method, constructor, or block. They are only accessible within the method, constructor, or block where they are declared. Their scope is limited to the block in which they are declared.

---

### Scope Rules

- **Class-Level Variables (Instance and Static)**: Can be accessed from anywhere within the class, regardless of where they are declared. However, if a local variable with the same name exists in a method, the local variable will take precedence (this is called variable shadowing).
- **Local Variables**: Only accessible within the block they are declared in. They cannot be accessed outside that block.

---

### Variable Shadowing

If a local variable has the same name as an instance or static variable, the local variable will "shadow" the class-level variable within the scope of the local variable. To access the class-level variable, you can use the `this` keyword for instance variables or the class name for static variables.

---

**Example:**

```java
public class F {
    private int x = 0; // Instance variable
    private int y = 0; // Instance variable

    public F() {
        // Constructor
    }

    public void p() {
        int x = 1; // Local variable (shadows the instance variable x)
        System.out.println("x = " + x); // Refers to the local variable x
        System.out.println("y = " + y); // Refers to the instance variable y
    }
}
```

---

**Output:**

```
x = 1
y = 0
```

---

**Explanation:**

- The local variable `x` in the method `p()` shadows the instance variable `x`. Therefore, `System.out.println("x = " + x);` prints the value of the local variable `x`, which is `1`.
- The instance variable `y` is not shadowed, so `System.out.println("y = " + y);` prints the value of the instance variable `y`, which is `0`.

---

### Key Points:

- **Instance and Static Variables**: Have class-level scope and can be accessed from anywhere within the class.
- **Local Variables**: Have block-level scope and can only be accessed within the block they are declared in.
- **Variable Shadowing**: When a local variable has the same name as an instance or static variable, the local variable takes precedence within its scope. To access the class-level variable, use `this` for instance variables or the class name for static variables.
- **Order of Declaration**: Class members (variables and methods) can be declared in any order within the class, except when a data field is initialized based on another data field. In such cases, the other data field must be declared first.

---

**Example of Variable Shadowing with `this`:**

```java
public class Circle {
    private double radius; // Instance variable

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius; // Use 'this' to refer to the instance variable
    }

    public void setRadius(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius; // Use 'this' to refer to the instance variable
    }
}
```

---

### Key Points for Variable Scope:

- **Class-Level Variables**: Accessible throughout the class.
- **Local Variables**: Limited to the block they are declared in.
- **Shadowing**: Local variables can shadow class-level variables. Use `this` to access the class-level variable.
- **Order of Declaration**: Class members can be declared in any order, except when one field depends on another.

---

By understanding the scope of variables, you can avoid common pitfalls such as variable shadowing and ensure that your variables are accessible where they are needed. This helps in writing clear and maintainable code.

---

## 9.13. The `this` Reference

---

### Key Concepts:

### The `this` Keyword

The `this` keyword in Java refers to the current instance of the class. It is used to:

- Access instance variables and methods of the current object.
- Differentiate between instance variables and parameters or local variables with the same name.
- Invoke another constructor of the same class (constructor chaining).

---

### Using `this` to Access Instance Members

- When a method parameter or local variable has the same name as an instance variable, the parameter or local variable shadows the instance variable. The `this` keyword can be used to explicitly refer to the instance variable.

Example: `this.radius = radius;` in a constructor or setter method.

---

### Using `this` to Invoke Another Constructor

- The `this` keyword can be used to call one constructor from another constructor in the same class. This is known as constructor chaining.
- The call to another constructor must be the first statement in the constructor.

Example: `this(1.0);` in a no-arg constructor to call a parameterized constructor.

---

**Example**:

- The example provided demonstrates how to use the `this` keyword to reference instance variables and to invoke another constructor.

---

**Example:**

---

```java
public class Circle {
    private double radius;

    // No-arg constructor
    public Circle() {
        this(1.0); // Invoke the parameterized constructor with a default radius of 1.0
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius; // Use 'this' to refer to the instance variable
    }

    // Setter method
    public void setRadius(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius; // Use 'this' to refer to the instance variable
    }

    // Getter method
    public double getRadius() {
        return radius;
    }

    // Method to calculate area
    public double getArea() {
        return radius * radius * Math.PI;
    }
}
```

### Key Points:

- **Accessing Instance Variables**: Use `this` to refer to instance variables when they are shadowed by method parameters or local variables.
- **Constructor Chaining**: Use `this(arg-list)` to call another constructor in the same class. This must be the first statement in the constructor.
- **Readability**: Using `this` can improve code readability by making it clear when you are referring to instance variables.

---

**Example of Constructor Chaining:**

```java
public class Circle {
    private double radius;

    // No-arg constructor
    public Circle() {
        this(1.0); // Calls the parameterized constructor with a default radius of 1.0
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius; // Use 'this' to refer to the instance variable
    }
}
```

---

### Key Points for Using `this` in Java

- **Instance Variable Access**: Use `this` to access instance variables when they are shadowed by local variables or parameters.
- **Constructor Chaining**: Use `this(arg-list)` to call another constructor in the same class. This must be the first statement in the constructor.
- **Readability and Clarity**: Using `this` can make the code more readable and clarify the intent, especially when distinguishing between instance variables and local variables.

---

**Example of Shadowing and Using `this`:**

```java
public class Circle {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius; // 'this.radius' refers to the instance variable, 'radius' refers to the parameter
    }

    public void setRadius(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius; // 'this.radius' refers to the instance variable, 'radius' refers to the parameter
    }
}
```

---

### The `this` Reference in Java

- **Instance Members**: Use `this` to access instance variables and methods.
- **Constructor Chaining**: Use `this(arg-list)` to invoke another constructor in the same class.
- **Avoiding Shadowing**: Use `this` to avoid confusion when local variables or parameters shadow instance variables.
