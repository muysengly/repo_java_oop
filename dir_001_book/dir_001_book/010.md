# Chapter 10: Object-Oriented Thinking

---

## 10.1. Introduction

---

This section introduces the focus of Chapter 10, which is on **class design** and the differences between **procedural programming** and **object-oriented programming (OOP)**. The chapter builds on the previous chapter's introduction to objects and classes, where you learned how to define classes, create objects, and use them. The approach of the book is to teach problem-solving and fundamental programming techniques before diving into OOP.

---

### Key Points:

1. **Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming**:

   - **Procedural programming** focuses on designing methods (functions) and separates data from actions.
   - **Object-oriented programming** couples data and methods together into objects, focusing on objects and operations on them.

2. **Benefits of OOP**:

   - OOP provides more flexibility and modularity for building reusable software.
   - It integrates data and actions into objects, making it easier to model real-world scenarios.

---

3. **Class Design**:

   - The chapter will use examples to illustrate the advantages of the object-oriented approach.
   - You will learn how to design new classes and use them in applications, as well as how to use new classes from the Java API.

---

4. **Learning Objectives**:
   - Apply class abstraction to develop software.
   - Explore the differences between procedural and object-oriented paradigms.
   - Discover relationships between classes.
   - Design programs using the object-oriented paradigm.
   - Use wrapper classes for primitive values, and understand automatic conversion between primitive types and wrapper class types.
   - Use `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` for large numbers with arbitrary precision.
   - Process immutable strings using the `String` class and mutable strings using `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`.

---

## 10.2. Class Abstraction and Encapsulation

---

---

### Key Points:

1. **Class Abstraction**:

   - **Definition**: Class abstraction is the separation of class implementation from its use. The user of a class does not need to know how the class is implemented; they only need to know how to use it.
   - **Example**: You can create a `Circle` object and calculate its area without knowing the internal details of how the area is computed.
   - **Abstract Data Type (ADT)**: A class is also known as an abstract data type because it encapsulates data and operations on that data, providing a clear interface for interaction.

---

2. **Class Encapsulation**:

   - **Definition**: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal details of a class from the user. The implementation details are encapsulated and hidden, exposing only the necessary methods and properties.
   - **Example**: In a computer system, components like the CPU, memory, and disk are encapsulated. You only need to know how to use them, not how they work internally.
   - **Class Contract**: The public constructors, methods, and fields that are accessible from outside the class, along with their expected behavior, form the class's contract. Users interact with the class through this contract.

---

3. **Real-Life Analogies**:

   - **Computer System**: Each component (e.g., CPU, memory) can be viewed as an object with properties and methods. You don't need to know how each component works internally to use them.
   - **Loan Example**: A loan can be modeled as an object of a `Loan` class, with properties like interest rate, loan amount, and loan period, and methods to calculate monthly and total payments.

---

4. **Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Approach**:

   - In procedural programming, data and actions are separate, and data is passed to methods.
   - In OOP, data and actions are integrated into objects, making it easier to manage and reuse code.

---

5. **UML Class Diagram**:

   - The UML diagram for the `Loan` class shows the properties (e.g., `annualInterestRate`, `loanAmount`) and methods (e.g., `getMonthlyPayment`, `getTotalPayment`).
   - The UML diagram serves as the contract for the class, showing how users can interact with it.

---

6. **Implementation Example**:
   - The `Loan` class is implemented with constructors, getter and setter methods, and methods to calculate monthly and total payments.
   - The class is designed to be reusable and customizable through its constructors and methods.

---

### Important Pedagogical Tip:

- **Using UML Diagrams**: You can write a test program using the UML diagram for a class (e.g., `Loan`) without knowing its implementation. This demonstrates that developing a class and using it are separate tasks, and it helps in understanding how to implement a class by first using it.

---

### Key Questions:

- **Immutable Classes**: If you redefine the `Loan` class without setter methods, it becomes immutable, meaning its state cannot be changed after creation.

---

## 10.3. Thinking in Objects

---

---

### Key Points:

1. **Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Paradigm**:

   - **Procedural Programming**: Focuses on designing methods (functions) and separates data from actions. Data is passed to methods as arguments.
   - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Combines data and methods into objects. Actions are defined along with the data in objects, making it easier to manage and reuse code.

---

2. **Advantages of OOP**:

   - **Integration of Data and Actions**: Objects encapsulate both data and the methods that operate on that data, leading to more organized and modular code.
   - **Real-World Modeling**: OOP allows you to model real-world entities as objects, making it easier to understand and design complex systems.
   - **Reusability**: Objects can be reused across different programs, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

---

3. **Example: BMI Class**:

   - **Problem**: In procedural programming, computing BMI (Body Mass Index) involves passing weight and height as arguments to a method. This approach lacks the ability to associate additional data (e.g., name, age) with the BMI calculation.
   - **OOP Solution**: The `BMI` class encapsulates the name, age, weight, and height as instance variables, along with methods to compute BMI and determine BMI status (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight).
   - **UML Diagram**: The `BMI` class includes properties like `name`, `age`, `weight`, and `height`, and methods like `getBMI()` and `getStatus()`.

---

4. **Implementation of BMI Class**:

   - The `BMI` class is implemented with constructors to initialize the object, methods to compute BMI, and methods to return the BMI status.
   - The class allows for easy reuse and extension, as it encapsulates all relevant data and methods within a single object.

---

5. **Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Code**:

   - **Procedural Code**: Involves separate variables and methods, making it harder to manage and extend.
   - **OOP Code**: Integrates data and methods into objects, making it easier to manage and extend. For example, the `BMI` class can easily be extended to include additional properties like birth date or gender.

---

6. **Key Question**:
   - **Immutable Classes**: The `BMI` class in the example is mutable because it allows changes to its properties (e.g., weight, height) through setter methods. If setter methods are removed, the class becomes immutable.

---

### Key Takeaways:

- **Thinking in Objects**: OOP encourages you to think in terms of objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate both data and behavior.
- **Reusability and Maintainability**: By encapsulating data and methods within objects, OOP makes it easier to reuse and maintain code.
- **Real-World Modeling**: OOP allows you to model real-world entities more naturally, making it easier to design and understand complex systems.

---

## 10.4. Class Relationships

---

---

### **Association**:

- **Definition**: Association is a general binary relationship that describes an activity between two classes. It represents a "using" relationship where one class uses another class.
- **Example**: A `Student` taking a `Course` is an association between the `Student` class and the `Course` class. Similarly, a `Faculty` member teaching a `Course` is an association between the `Faculty` class and the `Course` class.

---

- **UML Notation**: Associations are represented by a solid line between two classes, with optional labels and role names. Multiplicity (e.g., 1..\*, 0..3) indicates how many objects of one class are related to objects of another class.
- **Implementation**: Associations are typically implemented using data fields and methods. For example, a `Student` class may have a list of `Course` objects, and a `Course` class may have a list of `Student` objects.

---

### 1. **Aggregation**:

- **Definition**: Aggregation is a special form of association that represents an **ownership** relationship between two objects. It models a "has-a" relationship where one object (the owner) contains another object (the owned).
- **Example**: A `Student` has an `Address`. The `Address` can exist independently of the `Student`, so this is an aggregation relationship.
- **UML Notation**: Aggregation is represented by a line with a hollow diamond on the side of the aggregating class (the owner).
- **Implementation**: Aggregation is implemented using data fields in the aggregating class. For example, the `Student` class may have an `Address` field.

---

### 3. **Composition**:

- **Definition**: Composition is a stronger form of aggregation where the existence of the aggregated object is dependent on the aggregating object. If the aggregating object is destroyed, the aggregated object is also destroyed.
- **Example**: A `Student` has a `Name`. The `Name` cannot exist without the `Student`, so this is a composition relationship.
- **UML Notation**: Composition is represented by a line with a filled diamond on the side of the aggregating class.
- **Implementation**: Composition is also implemented using data fields, but the aggregated object is tightly bound to the aggregating object. For example, the `Student` class may have a `Name` field.

---

### 4. **Key Differences Between Aggregation and Composition**:

- **Aggregation**: The aggregated object can exist independently of the aggregating object (e.g., an `Address` can exist without a `Student`).
- **Composition**: The aggregated object cannot exist independently of the aggregating object (e.g., a `Name` cannot exist without a `Student`).

---

### 5. **Self-Referential Relationships**:

- **Example**: A `Person` may have a `supervisor`, who is also a `Person`. This is an example of a self-referential relationship, where a class has a relationship with itself.
- **Implementation**: This can be implemented using a data field of the same class type. For example, the `Person` class may have a `Person` field for the supervisor.

---

### 6. **Key Questions**:

- **Common Relationships**: The common relationships among classes are association, aggregation, and composition.
- **UML Notation**: Aggregation is represented by a hollow diamond, and composition is represented by a filled diamond.
- **Why Both Are Called Composition**: For simplicity, both aggregation and composition are often referred to as composition, even though they have different levels of dependency.

---

### Key Takeaways:

- **Association**: Represents a general relationship between two classes, often implemented using data fields and methods.
- **Aggregation**: Represents a "has-a" relationship where the aggregated object can exist independently.
- **Composition**: Represents a stronger "has-a" relationship where the aggregated object cannot exist independently.
- **Designing Class Relationships**: Understanding these relationships helps in designing classes that accurately model real-world scenarios and maintain clear boundaries between objects.

## 10.7. Processing Primitive Data Type Values as Objects

---

This section discusses how **primitive data types** in Java can be treated as **objects** using **wrapper classes**. Wrapper classes are essential in scenarios where objects are required, such as when using Java collections or when methods expect object arguments.

---

### Key Points:

1. **Primitive Types vs. Objects**:

   - **Primitive Types**: Java's primitive types (e.g., `int`, `double`, `char`) are not objects and are stored directly in memory. They are efficient but lack the flexibility of objects.
   - **Objects**: Objects are instances of classes and can be used in more complex data structures like collections. However, they come with additional overhead.

---

2. **Wrapper Classes**:

   - **Definition**: Wrapper classes are classes that encapsulate primitive data types, allowing them to be treated as objects. Each primitive type has a corresponding wrapper class (e.g., `Integer` for `int`, `Double` for `double`, `Character` for `char`).
   - **Purpose**: Wrapper classes are used when an object representation of a primitive type is needed, such as in collections like `ArrayList` or when using methods that require objects.

---

3. **Numeric Wrapper Classes**:

   - **Examples**: `Integer`, `Double`, `Float`, `Long`, `Short`, `Byte`.
   - **Methods**: These classes provide methods to convert between primitive types and objects, such as `intValue()`, `doubleValue()`, and `valueOf()`.
   - **Constants**: They also provide useful constants like `MAX_VALUE` and `MIN_VALUE`, which represent the maximum and minimum values for the corresponding primitive type.

---

4. **Creating Wrapper Objects**:

   - **Constructors**: Wrapper objects can be created using constructors (e.g., `new Integer(5)`), but this approach is deprecated in Java 9.
   - **Static `valueOf` Method**: The preferred way to create wrapper objects is using the static `valueOf` method (e.g., `Integer.valueOf(5)`). This method may reuse existing objects for efficiency.

---

5. **Immutable Wrapper Objects**:

   - **Immutability**: Once a wrapper object is created, its value cannot be changed. This immutability ensures that the object's state remains consistent.
   - **Example**: `Integer x = Integer.valueOf(5);` creates an immutable `Integer` object with the value 5.

---

6. **Autoboxing and Unboxing**:

   - **Autoboxing**: The automatic conversion of a primitive type to its corresponding wrapper object (e.g., `Integer x = 5;`).
   - **Unboxing**: The automatic conversion of a wrapper object to its corresponding primitive type (e.g., `int y = x;`).
   - **Example**: The following code demonstrates autoboxing and unboxing:
     ```java
     Integer x = 5;  // Autoboxing: int to Integer
     int y = x;      // Unboxing: Integer to int
     ```

---

7. **Useful Methods in Wrapper Classes**:

   - **Conversion Methods**: Methods like `intValue()`, `doubleValue()`, and `toString()` allow conversion between different types.
   - **Comparison Methods**: The `compareTo` method compares two wrapper objects and returns `1`, `0`, or `-1` depending on whether the current object is greater than, equal to, or less than the other object.
   - **Parsing Methods**: Methods like `parseInt()` and `parseDouble()` convert strings to primitive types.

---

8. **Example Code**:
   - The following code demonstrates the use of wrapper classes:
     ```java
     Integer x = Integer.valueOf(5);
     Double y = Double.valueOf("3.14");
     int z = x.intValue();
     double w = y.doubleValue();
     ```

---

### Key Questions:

- **Primitive-Type Wrapper Classes**: Wrapper classes like `Integer`, `Double`, and `Character` allow primitive types to be treated as objects.
- **Compilation of Statements**: The section provides examples of statements that can or cannot be compiled, such as `Integer i = new Integer("23");` (deprecated) vs. `Integer i = Integer.valueOf("23");` (preferred).
- **Conversion Between Types**: Methods like `valueOf()`, `parseInt()`, and `toString()` are used to convert between primitive types, strings, and wrapper objects.

---

### Key Takeaways:

- **Wrapper Classes**: Essential for treating primitive types as objects, especially in collections and when methods require object arguments.
- **Autoboxing and Unboxing**: Automatically convert between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper objects, simplifying code.
- **Immutability**: Wrapper objects are immutable, ensuring consistent state and thread safety.

This section provides a comprehensive overview of how to use wrapper classes to process primitive data types as objects, which is crucial for many advanced Java programming tasks. The next section will explore automatic conversion between primitive types and wrapper class types.

---

## 10.8. Automatic Conversion between Primitive Types and Wrapper Class Types

---

- **Boxing**: Converting a primitive value to a wrapper object.
- **Unboxing**: Converting a wrapper object to a primitive value.
- **Autoboxing**: Automatic conversion of primitive types to their corresponding wrapper classes.
- **Autounboxing**: Automatic conversion of wrapper classes to their corresponding primitive types.

---

### Examples:

```java
Integer intObject = 2; // Autoboxing
int i = intObject; // Autounboxing
```

---

### Key Points:

- Autoboxing and autounboxing simplify code by reducing the need for explicit conversions.
- Useful in collections that require objects, such as `ArrayList<Integer>`.

---

### Code Example:

```java
Integer[] intArray = {1, 2, 3};
System.out.println(intArray[0] + intArray[1] + intArray[2]); // Autounboxing
```

---

## 10.9. The BigInteger and BigDecimal Classes

---

### Overview:

- **BigInteger** and **BigDecimal** classes are used for mathematical operations involving very large integers and high-precision floating-point numbers.
- Both classes are immutable and part of the `java.math` package.

---

### BigInteger:

- Represents integers of arbitrary precision.
- Useful for computations that exceed the range of primitive data types like `long`.
- Common methods: `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()`, `remainder()`, `compareTo()`.

---

### BigDecimal:

- Represents floating-point numbers with arbitrary precision.
- Useful for financial and monetary calculations requiring exact precision.
- Common methods: `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()`, `remainder()`, `compareTo()`.

---

### Example:

```java
import java.math.BigInteger;
import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.math.RoundingMode;

public class BigNumbersExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // BigInteger example
        BigInteger bigInt1 = new BigInteger("9223372036854775807");
        BigInteger bigInt2 = new BigInteger("2");
        BigInteger bigIntResult = bigInt1.multiply(bigInt2);
        System.out.println("BigInteger Result: " + bigIntResult);

        // BigDecimal example
        BigDecimal bigDec1 = new BigDecimal("1.0");
        BigDecimal bigDec2 = new BigDecimal("3");
        BigDecimal bigDecResult = bigDec1.divide(bigDec2, 20, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);
        System.out.println("BigDecimal Result: " + bigDecResult);
    }
}
```

---

### Key Points:

- **BigInteger** and **BigDecimal** provide methods for arithmetic operations, comparisons, and conversions.
- They are essential for applications requiring precision beyond the capabilities of primitive data types.
- Always use `BigDecimal(String)` for predictable results due to the precision issues with `BigDecimal(double)`.

---

## 10.10. The String Class

---

### Overview:

- The `String` class represents immutable sequences of characters.
- Strings are widely used in Java programming for text manipulation.

---

### Key Characteristics:

- **Immutable**: Once created, the contents of a `String` object cannot be changed.
- **Interned Strings**: JVM optimizes memory by storing identical string literals in a common pool.

---

### Common Methods:

- **charAt(int index)**: Returns the character at the specified index.
- **length()**: Returns the length of the string.
- **substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)**: Returns a new string that is a substring of this string.
- **indexOf(String str)**: Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified substring.
- **equals(Object anObject)**: Compares this string to the specified object.
- **compareTo(String anotherString)**: Compares two strings lexicographically.
- **toLowerCase() / toUpperCase()**: Converts all characters in the string to lower/upper case.
- **trim()**: Removes whitespace from both ends of the string.

---

Example:

```java
String message = "Welcome to Java";
System.out.println("Length: " + message.length());
System.out.println("Character at index 4: " + message.charAt(4));
System.out.println("Substring (0, 7): " + message.substring(0, 7));
System.out.println("Index of 'Java': " + message.indexOf("Java"));
System.out.println("Lowercase: " + message.toLowerCase());
System.out.println("Trimmed: " + message.trim());
```

---

### Replacing and Splitting Strings:

- **replace(char oldChar, char newChar)**: Returns a new string resulting from replacing all occurrences of `oldChar` with `newChar`.
- **split(String regex)**: Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression.

---

Example:

```java
String s = "Java#HTML#Perl";
String[] tokens = s.split("#");
for (String token : tokens) {
    System.out.println(token);
}
```

---

### Regular Expressions:

- **matches(String regex)**: Tells whether or not this string matches the given regular expression.
- **replaceAll(String regex, String replacement)**: Replaces each substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement.

---

Example:

```java
String s = "a+b$#c".replaceAll("[$+#]", "NNN");
System.out.println(s); // Output: aNNNbNNNNNNc
```

---

### Conversion between Strings and Arrays:

- **toCharArray()**: Converts this string to a new character array.
- **String(char[] value)**: Allocates a new `String` so that it represents the sequence of characters currently contained in the character array argument.

---

Example:

```java
char[] charArray = "Java".toCharArray();
String str = new String(charArray);
```

---

### Formatting Strings:

- **format(String format, Object... args)**: Returns a formatted string using the specified format string and arguments.

---

Example:

```java
String formattedString = String.format("The value of pi is %.2f", Math.PI);
System.out.println(formattedString); // Output: The value of pi is 3.14
```

---

## 10.11. The StringBuilder and StringBuffer Classes

---

### Overview:

- `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` are mutable sequences of characters.
- They are used for creating and manipulating dynamic string content.

---

### Key Differences:

- **StringBuilder**: Not synchronized, faster, used in single-threaded environments.
- **StringBuffer**: Synchronized, thread-safe, used in multi-threaded environments.

---

### Common Methods:

- **append()**: Adds text to the end.
- **insert()**: Inserts text at a specified position.
- **delete()**: Removes text from a specified range.
- **replace()**: Replaces text in a specified range.
- **reverse()**: Reverses the sequence of characters.
- **toString()**: Converts the builder to a `String`.

---

Example:

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
sb.append(" World");
sb.insert(5, ",");
sb.delete(5, 6);
sb.replace(5, 11, " Java");
sb.reverse();
System.out.println(sb.toString()); // Output: avaJ olleH
```

---

### Key Points:

- Use `StringBuilder` for better performance in single-threaded scenarios.
- Use `StringBuffer` for thread-safe operations in multi-threaded scenarios.
- Both classes provide methods to modify the content without creating new objects, improving performance.

---

### Code Example:

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.append("Welcome");
sb.append(" to");
sb.append(" Java");
System.out.println(sb.toString()); // Output: Welcome to Java
```

---

### Capacity and Length:

- **capacity()**: Returns the current capacity.
- **length()**: Returns the number of characters.
- **setLength()**: Sets the length of the sequence.

---

Example:

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(50);
System.out.println("Capacity: " + sb.capacity()); // Output: 50
sb.append("Hello");
System.out.println("Length: " + sb.length()); // Output: 5
```

---

### Tips:

- Use `trimToSize()` to reduce the capacity to the current length.
- Chain methods for concise code: `sb.append("Hello").append(" World");`

---

### Summary:

- `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` are essential for efficient string manipulation.
- Choose based on thread safety requirements and performance considerations.
