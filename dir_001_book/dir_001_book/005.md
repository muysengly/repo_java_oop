# Chapter 5: </br> Loops

---

## 5.1. Introduction

---

- **Loops** are fundamental constructs in programming that enable the repeated execution of a sequence of statements.

- This chapter introduces the concept of loops and examines the different types of loops in Java, including the `while`, `do-while`, and `for` loops.

---

### Need for Loops

- Writing the same block of code repeatedly is time-consuming and prone to errors.

- Loops simplify this process by automating repetitive tasks, making the code more efficient and easier to maintain.

- Loops are essential for processing collections of data, such as arrays or lists.

**Example:** Displaying a message like "Welcome to Java!" a hundred times can be efficiently done using a loop instead of writing the print statement a hundred times.

---

### Types of Loops in Java

- **`while` Loop:** Checks the condition **before** running. Use it when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.

- **`do-while` Loop:** Runs the loop body **at least once** before checking the condition. Use it when the loop must execute at least once.

- **`for` Loop:** Combines initialization, condition, and update in one line. It is best used when the number of iterations is known.

---

### Key Concepts

- **Loop Body:** The block of statements that are executed repeatedly.

- **Iteration:** A single execution of the loop body.

- **Loop-Continuation Condition:** A Boolean expression that determines whether the loop body will execute.

---

**Example:**

```java
int count = 0;
while (count < 100) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
    count++;
}
```

**Explain:**

- The `while` loop executes the print statement and increments the `count` variable until `count` is no longer less than 100.

- The loop-continuation condition, `count < 100`, determines the number of iterations.

- The `count++` statement increments the `count` variable after each iteration.

---

### Counter-Controlled Loop

- **Counter-controlled loop** is a loop that uses a counter to keep track of how many times it runs. It is useful when you already know how many times the loop should repeat.

---

### Infinite Loops

- **Infinite Loops:** Loops that never stop because the exit condition is never met.

- **Why Avoid Them?** They can freeze or crash your program.

- **Prevention Tips:**
  - Ensure the loop condition eventually evaluates to `false`.
  - Verify your logic to avoid errors such as missing updates or incorrect conditions.

**Tip:** To avoid infinite loops, carefully test your loop conditions and ensure there is a clear and reliable way to exit the loop.

---

## 5.2. The `while` Loop

---

- **The `while` loop** is a fundamental concept in Java. It enables you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`.

- This makes it particularly useful for tasks where the number of repetitions depends on a condition rather than being predetermined.

---

**Syntax:** The syntax for a `while` loop is:

```java
while (loop-continuation-condition) {
    // Loop body
    Statement(s);
}
```

**Explain:** The loop-continuation condition is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed.

---

### Flowchart

<img title="" src="./images\image-20250307153719082.png" alt="image-20250307153719082" style="zoom: 80%;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color:white;" data-align="center">

---

### Execution Process

- **Statements Before the Loop** are the blocks of code executed before the loop starts. These may include variable initialization or other setup tasks.

- **Loop-Continuation Condition** is evaluated first. If it is `true`, the loop body is executed. If it is `false`, the loop terminates.

- **Statements Inside the Loop Body** are the blocks of code executed repeatedly as long as the loop-continuation condition is `true`.

---

**Example:** Displaying "Welcome to Java!" a hundred times using a `while` loop:

```java
int count = 0;
while (count < 100) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
    count++;
}
```

**Explain:** In this example, the loop body prints the message "Welcome to Java!" and increments the `count` variable until the `count` is no longer less than 100.

---

### Counter-Controlled `while` Loop

**Example:** Displaying numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop:

```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 10) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

**Explain:**

- The loop-continuation condition `i <= 10` determines how many times the loop will execute.

- Inside the loop body, the current value of `i` is printed, and then `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

---

### Infinite `while` Loop

**Example:** Infinite loop:

```java
while (true) {
    // Loop body
}
```

**Note:** This loop will run indefinitely because the loop-continuation condition `true` is always true.

---

### Common Pitfalls

- **Off-By-One Error:** A common mistake where a loop executes either one iteration too many or one iteration too few. This typically occurs due to incorrect initialization, condition, or increment/decrement logic in the loop.  
  **Example:** If the condition is `count <= 100` instead of `count < 100`, the loop will execute 101 times.

- **Infinite Loops:** Always ensure that the loop-continuation condition is designed to eventually evaluate to `false`. This prevents the loop from running indefinitely, which can cause the program to hang or crash.

---

## 5.3. Case Study: Guessing Numbers

Practice.

---

## 5.4. Loop Design Strategies

---

- **Designing effective loops** involves understanding the steps that need to be repeated and writing appropriate conditions to terminate the loop.

- Writing correct loops can be challenging for novice programmers, but following a clear strategy can help.

---

### Three steps to help design a loop

Step 1: Identify the Statements to be Repeated

- Determine which statements need to be executed multiple times.

**Example:** Generating random numbers multiple times.

```java
// Statements to be repeated
int number = (int) (Math.random() * 10) + 1;
```

---

Step 2: Wrap the Statements in a Loop

- Use a `while` loop to repeatedly execute the statements.

**Example:** Generating random numbers until the sum is greater than 100

```java
while (true) {
    // Statements to be repeated
    int number = (int) (Math.random() * 10) + 1;
}
```

---

Step 3: Add Loop Control

- Code the loop-continuation condition and add statements to control the loop.

**Example:** Generating random numbers until the sum is greater than 100

```java
int sum = 0;
while (sum <= 100) {
    // Generate a random number
    int number = (int) (Math.random() * 10) + 1;
    sum += number;
}
```

---

### Example Multiple Subtraction Quiz

- Generates five subtraction questions and reports the number of correct answers.

**Step 1: Identify the Statements to be Repeated:**

- Generate two random numbers.

- Prompt the user with a subtraction question.

- Evaluate the user's answer.

---

```java
// Generate two random numbers
int number1 = (int) (Math.random() * 10);
int number2 = (int) (Math.random() * 10);

// Prompt the user with a subtraction question
System.out.print("What is " + number1 + " - " + number2 + "? ");
int answer = input.nextInt();

// Grade the answer
if (number1 - number2 == answer) {
    System.out.println("You are correct!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Your answer is wrong.");
    System.out.println(number1 + " - " + number2
        + " should be " + (number1 - number2));
}
```

---

**Step 2: Wrap the Statements in a Loop:**

- Use a loop to repeat the steps five times.

**Step 3: Add a Loop Control Variable and Condition:**

- Use a control variable to execute the loop five times.

- This program follows a loop design strategy to ensure correct execution and efficient control of the loop.

---

```java
// Initialize the count of correct answers
int correctCount = 0;

// Repeat the quiz five times
int count = 0;

while (count < 5) {
    // Generate two random numbers
    int number1 = (int) (Math.random() * 10);
    int number2 = (int) (Math.random() * 10);

    // Prompt the user with a subtraction question
    System.out.print("What is " + number1 + " - " + number2 + "? ");
    int answer = input.nextInt();

    // Grade the answer
    if (number1 - number2 == answer) {
        System.out.println("You are correct!");
        correctCount++;
    } else {
        System.out.println("Your answer is wrong.");
        System.out.println(number1 + " - " + number2
            + " should be " + (number1 - number2));
    }

    // Increase the count
    count++;
}
```

---

## 5.5. Controlling a Loop with <br> User Confirmation or a Sentinel Value

---

- **Controlling loops effectively** is crucial in programming to ensure they execute the correct number of times.

- This section explores how to use user confirmation or a sentinel value to control loop execution.

---

### User Confirmation

- You can control a loop by prompting the user for confirmation after each iteration.

- This approach allows the user to decide whether to continue or terminate the loop.

---

**Example:** Using user confirmation to control a loop

```java
char continueLoop = 'Y';
while (continueLoop == 'Y') {
    // Execute loop body
    ...
    // Prompt user for confirmation
    System.out.print("Enter Y to continue and N to quit: ");
    continueLoop = input.nextLine().charAt(0);
}
```

**Note:** This allows the user to decide whether to continue or terminate the loop.

---

### Sentinel Value

- A sentinel value is a special value that indicates the termination of a loop.

- This technique is particularly useful when processing a sequence of input values.

---

**Example:** Reading input until a sentinel value is entered

```java
int data;
int sum = 0;
System.out.print("Enter an integer (the input ends if it is 0): ");
data = input.nextInt();

while (data != 0) {
    sum += data;
    System.out.print("Enter an integer (the input ends if it is 0): ");
    data = input.nextInt();
}

System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
```

**Note:** In this example, the sentinel value `0` signals the end of input, and the loop terminates.

---

### Important Points

- **User Confirmation:** Enables dynamic control of loop termination based on user input.

- **Sentinel Value:** Uses a predefined condition to terminate the loop, commonly applied in data processing.

---

## 5.6. The `do-while` Loop

---

- The **`do-while` loop** is similar to the `while` loop, with one key difference: the loop body is executed at least once before the loop-continuation condition is evaluated.

---

**Syntax:** The syntax for a `do-while` loop

```java
do {
    // Loop body
} while (loop-continuation-condition);
```

**Note:** The loop body is executed first, and then the loop-continuation condition is evaluated.

---

---

### Key Components of `do-while` Loop

- **Statements Before the Loop** are the blocks of code executed before the loop starts.

- **Statements in the Loop Body** are the blocks of code executed repeatedly.

- **Loop-Continuation Condition** is a Boolean expression that determines whether the loop body will be executed.

---

### `while` vs. `do-while`

|       Feature       | `while` Loop                           | `do-while` Loop                   |
| :-----------------: | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Condition Check** | Before loop body.                      | After loop body.                  |
|    **Execution**    | May not execute if condition is false. | Executes at least once.           |
|    **Use Case**     | When iterations depend on condition.   | When loop must run at least once. |

---

**Example:** Comparing `while` and `do-while` loops

- `while` loop (may not execute)

```java
int i = 5;
while (i < 5) {
    // This will not execute
    System.out.println("Inside while loop");
    i++;
}
```

- `do-while` loop (executes at least once)

```java
int i = 5;
do {
    // This will execute once
    System.out.println("Inside do-while loop");
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

---

## 5.7. The `for` Loop

---

### Introduction

- The **`for` loop** is a concise and efficient construct for writing loops in Java.

- It integrates initialization, condition checking, and increment/decrement into a single line, making it particularly suitable for counter-controlled loops.

---

**Syntax:** The syntax for a `for` loop is:

```java
for (initial-action;
    loop-continuation-condition;
    action-after-each-iteration
) {
    // Loop body
}
```

**Note:**

- The `initial-action` initializes the loop control variable.

- The `loop-continuation-condition` determines whether the loop body executes.

- The `action-after-each-iteration` updates the loop control variable.

- The loop body executes as long as the condition is true.

---

### Flowchart

<img title="" src="./images\image-20250307153901422.png" alt="image-20250307153901422" style="zoom: 80%;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color:white;" data-align="center" >

---

- **Initial Action:** This is the code that runs before the loop begins. It typically initializes variables or sets up conditions required for the loop to execute.

- **Loop-Continuation Condition:** A Boolean expression that determines whether the loop should continue running. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the loop body executes; otherwise, the loop stops.

- **Statements in the Loop Body:** These are the instructions executed repeatedly as long as the loop-continuation condition remains `true`.

- **Action After Each Iteration:** This is the code that runs after each iteration of the loop body. It often updates variables or performs tasks necessary for the next iteration.

---

**Example:** Displaying "Welcome to Java!" a hundred times using a `for` loop:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
}
```

**Note:**

- The variable `i` starts at 0.

- The loop runs while `i < 100`, printing "Welcome to Java!" and incrementing `i` by 1.

- When `i` reaches 100, the condition becomes false, and the loop terminates.

---

### Advantages

- **Concise and Clear:** Combines initialization, condition checking, and updates in a single line.

- **Reduces Errors:** Minimizes the risk of missing updates, which can lead to infinite loops.

---

### Multiple Control Variables

- A `for` loop can have multiple control variables, separated by commas in the initialization and update sections.

- This feature allows you to use multiple variables to control the loop efficiently.

**Example:** Using multiple control variables in a `for` loop

```java
for (int i = 0, j = 0; i + j < 10; i++, j++) {
    // Loop body
}
```

---

### Infinite Loop

- In a `for` loop, you can create an infinite loop by omitting the initialization, condition, or update parts.

**Syntax:**

```java
for (;;) {
    // Infinite loop
}
```

**Note:** It's better to use `while (true)` for clarity

---

**Example:** Summing numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop:

```java
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    sum += i;
}
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
```

---

## 5.8. Which Loop to Use?

---

| **Scenario**                                 | **Recommended**              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Number of iterations is known in advance     | `for` loop                   |
| Number of iterations is unknown              | `while` loop                 |
| Loop body must execute at least once         | `do-while` loop              |
| Iterating over a collection or array         | Enhanced `for` loop          |
| Infinite loop                                | `while (true)` or `for (;;)` |
| Loop with multiple control variables         | `for` loop                   |
| Loop controlled by user confirmation         | `do-while` loop              |
| Loop controlled by a sentinel value          | `while` loop                 |
| Nested iterations (e.g., working with grids) | Nested `for` loops           |

---

### Pretest vs. Posttest Loops

- **Pretest Loop**: A loop where the condition is evaluated before executing the loop body. Both `while` and `for` loops are pretest loops because the condition is checked prior to the execution of the loop body.

- **Posttest Loop**: A loop where the condition is evaluated after executing the loop body. The `do-while` loop is a posttest loop because the condition is checked after the loop body has been executed.

---

### Expressive Equivalence

- The `while`, `do-while`, and `for` loops are expressively equivalent, meaning you can write a loop in any of these three forms.

---

### General Guidance

Choose the loop type that feels easiest for you to use.

- **`for` Loop:** Best when you know how many times the loop should run, such as printing a message 100 times.

- **`while` Loop:** Best when the number of iterations depends on a condition, such as reading numbers until the user enters 0.

- **`do-while` Loop:** Best when the loop must execute at least once, such as asking for user input.

---

### Common Mistakes

- Avoid placing a semicolon immediately after the `for` statement, as it will prevent the loop from executing correctly.

- Ensure the loop condition eventually evaluates to `false` to avoid infinite loops.

---

## 5.9. Nested Loops

---

- You can place one loop inside another loop.

- This is called a nested loop and is useful for handling more complex tasks step by step.

---

### Definition

- Nested loops consist of an outer loop and one or more inner loops.

- Each time the outer loop repeats, the inner loops are re-entered and start anew.

---

### Multiplication Table

**Example:** Multiplication Table Program

```java
public class MultiplicationTable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Multiplication Table");
        System.out.print("   ");
        for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
            System.out.print("   " + j);
        }
        System.out.println("\n——————————————");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            System.out.print(i + " | ");
            for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
                System.out.printf("%4d", i * j);
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}                                                                  .
```

---

**Explain:**

- The outer loop `for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++)` iterates through the rows of the table.

- The inner loop `for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++)` iterates through the columns of the table.

- The product of `i` and `j` is calculated and printed in a formatted manner.

- The program generates a multiplication table ranging from 1 to 9.

---

### Performance Consideration

- Nested loops can slow down a program because they significantly increase the number of iterations.

- For instance, if you have three nested loops, each running 100 times, the code will execute a total of 1 million iterations.

---

### Practical Tips

- Use nested loops when working with grids, tables, or multi-level data.

- Clearly name each loop's control variable to avoid confusion.

- Limit the number of iterations in nested loops to maintain program efficiency.

---

## 5.10. Minimizing Numeric Errors

---

### Introduction

- Minimizing numeric errors in loops is essential to ensure accurate results when working with floating-point numbers.

- This section explores strategies to reduce errors when handling floating-point numbers in loops.

---

### Floating-Point Arithmetic

- Floating-point numbers are represented approximately in computers, which can lead to precision errors.

**Example:** Adding numbers from 0.01 to 1.0 using a `for` loop. The exact sum should be 50.50, but using the `float` type might result in an imprecise value, such as 50.499985.

---

```java
float sum = 0;
for (float i = 0.01f; i <= 1.0f; i += 0.01f) {
    sum += i;
}
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
```

**output:**

```
The sum is 50.499985
```

---

### Precision Improvement

- Using a double type instead of float might improve precision slightly, but still not perfect.

**Example:** Using double type:

```java
double sum = 0;
for (double i = 0.01; i <= 1.0; i += 0.01) {
    sum += i;
}
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
```

**Note:** Even with double, the result might not be exact (e.g., 49.50000000000003) due to floating-point arithmetic.

---

### Solution Using Integer Count

- Use an integer counter to ensure all numbers are added to the sum precisely.

**Example:** Using integer count:

```java
double sum = 0;
double currentValue = 0.01;
for (int count = 0; count < 100; count++) {
    sum += currentValue;
    currentValue += 0.01;
}
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
```

Output:

```
The sum is 50.5
```

---

### Adding in Different Orders

- Adding numbers from smallest to largest is more accurate than adding from largest to smallest.

**Example:** Adding from largest to smallest:

```java
double sum = 0;
double currentValue = 1.0;
for (int count = 0; count < 100; count++) {
    sum += currentValue;
    currentValue -= 0.01;
}
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
```

**Note:** This method might result in less accuracy due to finite-precision arithmetic.

---

## 5.11. Case Studies

Practice.

---

## 5.12. Keywords `break` and `continue`

---

### The `break` Keyword

- The `break` keyword is used to stop a loop right away.

- It is helpful when you want to end the loop as soon as a certain condition is true.

**Example:** Using `break` to terminate a loop:

```java
while (number < 20) {
    if (sum >= 100) {
        break;
    }
    number++;
    sum += number;
}                                                                .
```

**Explain:** This code adds numbers from 1 to 20 until the sum reaches 100, using `break` to stop the loop.

---

### The `continue` Keyword

- The `continue` keyword skips the rest of the current loop and moves to the next iteration. It ignores the remaining code in the loop for that iteration.

**Example:** Using `continue` to skip an iteration:

```java
while (number < 20) {
    number++;
    if (number == 10 || number == 11) {
        continue;
    }
    sum += number;
}                                                                     .
```

**Explain:** This code adds numbers from 1 to 20 but skips numbers 10 and 11 using `continue`.

---

### Differences Between `break` and `continue`

- `break` completely stops the loop, while `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one.

- You can use `continue` in both `while` and `for` loops.

- In `while` and `do-while` loops, `continue` immediately checks the loop condition after it is used.

- In `for` loops, `continue` executes the update step (e.g., `i++`) before checking the loop condition.

---

**Note:**

- While `break` and `continue` can simplify coding in certain situations, excessive or improper use can make your program harder to understand and debug.

---

**Example:** Using `break` in loops

```java
int number = 0;
int sum = 0;

while (number < 20) {
    number++;
    sum += number;

    if (sum >= 100) {
        break;
    }
}

System.out.println("The number is " + number);
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
```

---

**Example:** Using `continue` in loops

```java
int number = 0;
int sum = 0;

while (number < 20) {
    number++;
    if (number == 10 || number == 11) {
        continue;
    }
    sum += number;
}

System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
```
