# Chapter 6: <br> Methods

---

## 6.1. Introduction

---

### Definition

- **Method**: A block of code that performs a specific task.

- **Belongs to a Class**: In object-oriented programming, methods are functions tied to a class.

- **Purpose**: Defines what an object can do (its behavior).

- **How to Use**: Call the method to execute its code and perform the task.

---

### Why Use Methods?

- **Problem**: Repeating code is inefficient and hard to maintain.

- **Solution**:
  - **Reuse Code**: Write once, use anywhere.
  - **Simplify**: Make code easier to read and debug.
  - **Modularize**: Break problems into smaller, manageable parts.

---

### Challenge

**Example**: Finding the sum of ranges (e.g., 1-10, 20-37) using repetitive code

```java
int sum1 = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    sum1 += i;
}

int sum2 = 0;
for (int i = 20; i <= 37; i++) {
    sum2 += i;
}
```

**Drawbacks**: Repetitive code, hard to maintain.

---

### Solution

**Example**: Finding the sum of ranges (e.g., 1-10, 20-37) using method

```java
public static int sum(int i1, int i2) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = i1; i <= i2; i++) {
        result += i;
    }
    return result;
}
```

**Advantage**: Flexible use: `sum(1, 10)`, `sum(20, 37)`, etc.

---

## 6.2. Defining a Method

---

### Anatomy of a Method

<img src="images\image-20250323202634172.png" alt="image-20250323202634172" />

---

### Syntax of a Method

**Syntax**: Method Declaration

```java
modifier returnValueType methodName(list of parameters) {
    // Method body
}
```

**Syntax**: Method Invocation

```java
methodName(argument1, argument2, ...);
```

---

### Components of a Method:

- **Modifier**: Defines who can access the method (e.g., `public`, `private`).

- **Return Type**: The type of value the method gives back (e.g., `int`, `void`).

- **Method Name**: The name used to call the method (e.g., `max`).

- **Parameters**: Inputs the method needs to work (e.g., `int num1, int num2`).

- **Body**: The code inside the method that does the work.

- **Return Statement**: Sends the result back to the caller.

---

### Type of Methods Modifiers

| **Modifier**  | **What It Does?**                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **default**   | Adds a default method in interfaces.                                     |
| **public**    | Makes the method accessible from any class.                              |
| **private**   | Restricts access to within the same class only.                          |
| **protected** | Allows access within the same package and subclasses.                    |
| **static**    | Links the method to the class, not an object.                            |
| **final**     | Prevents the method from being changed or overridden.                    |
| **abstract**  | Declares a method without implementation; must be defined in a subclass. |

---

| **Modifier**     | **What It Does?**                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **synchronized** | Ensures only one thread can use the method at a time (thread-safe).      |
| **strictfp**     | Makes floating-point calculations consistent across platforms.           |
| **native**       | Indicates the method is written in another language like C.              |
| **transient**    | Excludes the variable from being saved during serialization.             |
| **volatile**     | Ensures the variable is always read from main memory, not a cached copy. |

---

**Example:** Define a method to find the maximum of two numbers.

```java
public static int max(int num1, int num2) {
    if (num1 > num2)
        return num1;
    else
        return num2;
}
```

**Example**: Invoke the `max` method

```java
int larger = max(3, 4);
System.out.println(max(3, 4));
```

---

## 6.3. Calling a Method

---

### Types of Method Calls

**Example**: Call the value-returning method.

```java
int larger = max(3, 4);
System.out.println(max(3, 4));
```

**Example**: Call the void method.

```java
printMessage("Hello, World!");
```

---

### Flow of Control

- **When Called**: Program control is transferred to the method.

- **When Completed**: Control returns to the caller after execution.

---

**Example**: Maximum of Two Numbers

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i = 5, j = 2;
    int k = max(i, j);
    System.out.println("The maximum of " + i + " and "
        + j + " is " + k);
}

public static int max(int num1, int num2) {
    return (num1 > num2) ? num1 : num2;
}
```

**Explanation**:

- The `max` method is invoked from `main`.

- Values `i` and `j` are passed to `num1` and `num2`.

- The result is returned and stored in `k`.

---

### Key Notes

- **Return Statement**: Required for value-returning methods.

- **Void Methods**: Do not require a return statement but can use `return;` to terminate early.

- **Reusable Code**: Methods make coding easier by allowing you to write code once and use it multiple times.

---

## 6.4. Void vs. Value-Returning Methods

---

### What is Void Method?

- **Definition**: A void method does not return any value.

- **Purpose**: Perform an operation or action.

- **Invocation**: Must be called as a statement.

**Example**: Define a void method

```java
public static void printMessage(String message) {
    System.out.println(message);
}
```

**Example**: Call a void method

```java
printMessage("Hello, World!");
```

---

### What Are Value-Returning Methods?

- **Definition**: A method that returns a value to the caller.

- **Purpose**: Perform an operation and provide a result.

- **Invocation**: Can be used in expressions or assigned to variables.

**Example**: Define a value-returning method

```java
public static int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

**Example**: Call a value-returning method

```java
int sum = add(5, 10);
System.out.println(sum);
```

---

### Key Differences

| Feature              | Void Method          | Value-Returning Method             |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Return Type**      | `void`               | Data type (e.g., `int`)            |
| **Return Statement** | Optional (`return;`) | Required return with a value       |
| **Usage**            | Standalone statement | Assign to variables or expressions |

---

### Comparison Example

**Example**: Printing vs. Returning Grades (Void Method)

```java
public static void printGrade(double score) {
    if (score >= 90.0) System.out.println('A');
    else if (score >= 80.0) System.out.println('B');
    else if (score >= 70.0) System.out.println('C');
    else System.out.println('F');
}                                                                   .
```

**Example**: Returning Grades (Value-Returning Method)

```java
public static char getGrade(double score) {
    if (score >= 90.0) return 'A';
    else if (score >= 80.0) return 'B';
    else if (score >= 70.0) return 'C';
    else return 'F';
}                                                                   .
```

---

### When to Use Void vs. Value-Returning Methods

- **Void Methods**: When no value needs to be returned (e.g., logging, printing).

- **Value-Returning Methods**: When a result is needed for further operations.

---

## 6.5. Passing Arguments by Values

---

### What is Passing Arguments by Values?

- **Definition**: When a method is invoked, the value of the argument is passed to the method’s parameter.

- **Key Point**:
  - The method works with the value passed, not the actual variable.
  - Changes made to the parameter inside the method do not affect the argument outside.

---

**Example**: Incrementing a value inside a method.

```java
public class Increment {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 1;
        System.out.println("Before the call, x is " + x);
        increment(x);
        System.out.println("After the call, x is " + x);
    }

    public static void increment(int n) {
        n++;
        System.out.println("n inside the method is " + n);
    }
}                                                                   .
```

**Output**:

```
Before the call, x is 1
n inside the method is 2
After the call, x is 1                                              .
```

---

**Explanation**:

- The value of `x` remains unchanged after the method call.

- The method increments the value of `n` inside the method.

- The original value of `x` is not affected.

- The method works with a copy of the value of `x`.

- The method does not have access to the original variable `x`.

- The method only modifies the copy of the value.

---

**Example**: Swapping two values inside a method.

```java
public static void swap(int n1, int n2) {
    int temp = n1;
    n1 = n2;
    n2 = temp;
}
```

**Explanation**:

- Inside the method, the values of `n1` and `n2` swap.

- The original arguments (outside the method) remain unchanged.

---

### Key Notes on Pass-By-Value

- **Matching Parameters with Arguments**:

  - Arguments must align with parameters in:
    - **Order**: Follow the sequence of parameters.
    - **Number**: Match the exact count of parameters.
    - **Type**: Use compatible data types.

- **Key Effects**:
  - The original variables outside the method remain unchanged.
  - This protects the original data from being accidentally modified.

---

### When and Why to Use Pass-By-Value?

- **Advantages**:

  - Keeps the original data safe from changes.
  - Makes methods work independently without side effects.

- **Best Use Cases**:
  - When you need to perform calculations or tasks without altering the original data.

---

### Tip: Pass an Array as an Argument

**Example**: Summing a variable number of arguments.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    System.out.println(sum(numbers));
}

public static int sum(int... numbers) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int number : numbers) {
        total += number;
    }
    return total;
}                                                                   .
```

**Explanation**:

- The `...` syntax allows you to pass a variable number of arguments.

---

## 6.6. Modularizing Code

---

### What is Modularizing Code?

- **What is Modularizing Code?** Breaking code into smaller, easy-to-manage methods.

- **Why is it Useful?**
  - **Easier to Read**: Makes the logic simple to follow.
  - **Easier to Fix**: Errors are limited to specific methods.
  - **Reusable**: You can use the same methods in other programs.

---

<!-- ### Example: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)​ [ផលចែករួមធំបំផុត] -->

**Example**: Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. [តួចែករួមធំបំផុត]

```java
public static int gcd(int n1, int n2) {
    int gcd = 1;
    int k = 2; // Potential gcd
    while (k <= n1 && k <= n2) {
        if (n1 % k == 0 && n2 % k == 0)
            gcd = k; // Update gcd
        k++;
    }
    return gcd;
}
```

---

**Explanation**:

- The GCD logic is written as a separate method.

- This makes the code reusable in other programs.

- It simplifies the main program by focusing on the GCD calculation in one place.

- Easier to debug and understand.

- Promotes modular programming.

---

### Advantages of Modular Design

- **Avoids Repetition**: No need to write the same code multiple times.

- **Keeps Code Organized**: Each method solves one specific problem.

- **Easy to Update**: Fix or change one method without affecting others.

---

### Applying Modular Design

- **Breaking Down Complex Problems Using Methods**:
  - **Example**: Prime Number [ចំនួនបឋម] Program
    - **Submethods**:
      - `isPrime`: Checks if a number is prime.
      - `printPrimeNumbers`: Prints a list of prime numbers.
  - **Benefits**:
    - **Clearer Logic**: Each method focuses on one task.
    - **Reusable Code**: Methods can be used in other programs.

## 6.7. Case Study: <br> Converting Hexadecimals to Decimals

Practice.

---

## 6.8. Overloading Methods

---

### What is Method Overloading?

- **What is Method Overloading?** Method overloading happens when multiple methods have the **same name** but differ in:

  - **Number of parameters** (e.g., one method takes 2 inputs, another takes 3).
  - **Type of parameters** (e.g., one method uses `int`, another uses `double`).
  - **Order of parameters** (e.g., `int, double` vs. `double, int`).

---

- **Why Use Method Overloading?**
  - Makes your code easier to read and understand.
  - Lets you use the same method name for similar tasks, making it more flexible.

---

### Example of Overloading

**Example**: Overloading the `max` method to handle different data types.

```java
public static int max(int num1, int num2) {
    return (num1 > num2) ? num1 : num2;
}

public static double max(double num1, double num2) {
    return (num1 > num2) ? num1 : num2;
}

public static double max(double num1, double num2, double num3) {
    return Math.max(num1, Math.max(num2, num3));
}
```

---

**Explanation**:

- The `max` method is designed to work with different types of numbers.

- One version works with two integers.

- Another version works with two decimal numbers (doubles).

- A third version can handle three decimal numbers.

---

### Benefits of Overloading Methods

- **Better Code Reuse**: Use the same method name for similar tasks, no need to create many different names.

- **Easier to Maintain**: Group related tasks under one method name for better organization.

- **Simpler to Use**: Makes the code easier to understand and work with for everyone.

---

### Rules for Overloading

- Methods can have the **same name** but must differ in:

  - **Number of parameters** (e.g., 2 inputs vs. 3 inputs).
  - **Type of parameters** (e.g., `int` vs. `double`).
  - **Order of parameters** (e.g., `int, double` vs. `double, int`).

- **Important**: The return type **cannot** be the only difference between overloaded methods.

---

### Ambiguous Overloading

- **What is Ambiguity?** When the compiler cannot determine which method to call due to similar parameter types.
<!-- - **តើអ្វីជាភាពមិនច្បាស់លាស់?** នៅពេលដែល compiler មិនអាចកំណត់ថាតើត្រូវហៅ method មួយណាដោយសារតែប្រភេទប៉ារ៉ាម៉ែត្រស្រដៀងគ្នា។ -->

**Example**: Ambiguous Overloading

```java
public static void print(int num, double value) { ... }
public static void print(double value, int num) { ... }
```

**Explain:**

- Ambiguity arises if you call `print(5, 5);`.

- Compiler cannot determine which method to invoke.

- Solution: Avoid ambiguous overloading.

---

## 6.9. The Scope of Variables

---

### What is the Scope of a Variable?

- **What is Variable Scope?** The scope of a variable is the part of the program where you can use the variable.
<!-- - **តើអ្វីជាវិសាលភាពអថេរ?** វិសាលភាពនៃអថេរ គឺជាផ្នែកមួយនៃកម្មវិធីដែលអ្នកអាចប្រើអថេរបាន។ -->

---

### Local Variables

- **What Are Local Variables?**
  - Variables declared inside a method, block, or constructor.
  - They exist only while the method or block is running.
  - You cannot use them outside the method or block where they are defined.

---

**Example**:

```java
public void calculateSum() {
    int sum = 0; // Local variable
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            sum += i; // Updating the local variable
    }
    System.out.println(sum); // Can use 'sum' only inside this method
}
```

**Key Point**: Local variables are temporary and only used where they are created.

---

### Instance Variables

- **What Are Instance Variables?**
  - Declared inside a class but outside any methods.
  - Each object gets its own copy of these variables.

**Example**:

```java
public class Student {
    String name; // Instance variable
    int age;     // Instance variable

    public void displayInfo() {
            System.out.println("Name: " + name);
            System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }
}
```

---

**Key Points**:

- Instance variables store data specific to each object.

- You can access them using the object of the class.

- Example usage: `student1.name = "Alice";`

- Makes it easy to manage object-specific information.

---

### Class Variables

- **What Are Class Variables?**
  - Declared with the `static` keyword.
  - Shared by all objects of the class.
  - Only one copy of the variable exists for all objects.

---

**Example**:

```java
public class Employee {
    static int employeeCount; // Shared by all employees

    public static void increaseCount() {
            employeeCount++; // Increment the shared count
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

- The `employeeCount` variable is shared by all `Employee` objects.

- You can access it using the class name: `Employee.employeeCount`.

- Useful for storing information that is common to all objects.

---

### Key Notes on Variable Scope

- **Block Scope**: Variables declared inside `{}` can only be used within those braces.

- **Method Scope**: Variables declared inside a method can only be used in that method.

- **Class Scope**: Instance variables and static variables can be used anywhere in the class.

- **Lifetime**:
  - **Local Variables**: Exist only while the method or block is running.
  - **Instance Variables**: Exist as long as the object exists.
  - **Static Variables**: Exist as long as the program runs.

## 6.11. Method Abstraction <br> and Stepwise Refinement

---

<img src="images\image-20250323202825907.png" alt="image-20250323202825907" height="60%"/>

---

### What is Method Abstraction?

- **What is Method Abstraction?** Focuses on **what** a method does, not **how** it works. Hides the details of how the method is implemented.

- **Why Use It?** Makes code easier to read and understand. Encourages breaking problems into smaller, reusable parts.

- **Benefits**:
  - **Simplifies Code**: Focus on the big picture, not the details.
  - **Reusable**: Use the same method in different programs.
  - **Scalable**: Easy to add new features without changing existing code.

---

### Stepwise Refinement Process

1. **Break the Problem into Smaller Parts**: Divide the big problem into smaller, easier-to-solve pieces.

2. **Solve Each Part Step by Step**: Focus on solving one small part at a time.

3. **Put Everything Together**: Combine the solutions of all the small parts to solve the entire problem.

---

**Example**: Printing Prime Number [ចំនួនបឋម]

- **Step 1**: Write `isPrime` method to check if a number is prime.

- **Step 2**: Write `printPrimeNumbers` method to print prime numbers.

- **Step 3**: Combine methods to create the final solution.

---

**Example**: Printing Prime Numbers

```java
public static boolean isPrime(int number) {
    for (int divisor = 2; divisor <= number / 2; divisor++) {
        if (number % divisor == 0)
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}

public static void printPrimeNumbers(int count) {
    int number = 2;
    int printed = 0;
    while (printed < count) {
        if (isPrime(number)) {
            System.out.println(number);
            printed++;
        }
        number++;
    }
}                                                                 .
```
